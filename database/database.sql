Tonight I officially announce my retirement from the WWE.\nâ€˜I hear a mixed opinion out there. A lot of questions maybe, right? Like, why here? I want to talk about that for a second. I want to talk about Toronto. Matter of fact, I want to talk about Canada. Matter of fact, I want to talk about Canadians.\nâ€˜Iâ€™ve been doing this a while. Iâ€™ve been in WWE for over two decades and in that time Iâ€™ve seen incredible waves of prosperity like we got right now. WWE is the hottest ticket in town, no doubt.\nâ€˜And Iâ€™ve also seen tremendous hardship and thatâ€™s when nobody knows your name, nobody wants to be your friend and only the most dedicated, hardcore fans stand by your side.\nâ€˜So in all those years one of the most important, one of the most impressive things that I learned was whether the WWE was hot or cold, Canadians always show up.\nâ€˜All of you built this to what it is today which makes this, in my mind, the perfect place to say what Iâ€™ve got to say.\nâ€˜This farewell does not end tonight. It is filled with opportunity. Everybody, RAW makes history next year when it moves to Netflix. Iâ€™ve never been a part of RAW on Netflix. That is history. That is a first and I will be there.\nâ€˜Along with that history-making first, we are going to build so many unforgettable lasts.\nâ€˜The 2025 Royal Rumble will be my last. The 2025 Elimination Chamber will be my last and Iâ€™m here tonight to announce that WrestleMania Las Vegas in 2025 will be the last WrestleMania I compete in.\nâ€˜I know, I know. Thatâ€™s a lot to take in. Probably a lot of questions out there, which is why Iâ€™m telling you right now I am going to kick off the press conference right after the show and I will be fielding any and all questions to do with my retirement.\nâ€˜I want to say thank you. What an incredible gesture of kindness. I want to say thank you. Thank you so much for letting me play in the house that you built for so many years.\nâ€˜Thank you so much always for your voice, because itâ€™s really loud and your honesty because itâ€™s beautifully brutal. and most of all thank you so much for allowing me to be here with you tonight to let the world know we are planning something unforgettable which also involves me returning to Toronto to kick some a**.\nâ€˜So if you are watching at home or here in Toronto or if youâ€™re a WWE superstar, if you want some hurry up and come get some because the last time is now.â€™\nCena, who walked out naked at the Oscars in March, is level with WWE legend Ric Flair for the most world titles in wrestling history with 16.\nHeâ€™s been at the heart of many of the companyâ€™s legendary storylines in the past 20 years, battling the likes of Dwayne â€˜The Rockâ€™ Johnson, Triple H, Brock Lesnar and Randy Orton.\nCenaâ€™s acting career has taken off in recent years. He starred in the Fast and Furious franchise, as well as Barbie, Daddyâ€™s Home and Trainwreck.\nHeâ€™s also hosted Saturday Night Live and the ESPYâ€™s and is currently starring in Peacemaker on HBO.

The 2017 Honorary Oscar [&#8230;]','Donald Sutherland, the beloved actor who starred in scores of films from The Dirty Dozen, MASH and Klute to Animal House and Ordinary People to Pride & Prejudice and The Hunger Games franchise and won an Emmy for Citizen X, died Thursday in Miami after a long illness. He was 88.\nThe 2017 Honorary Oscar recipient also is the father of Emmy-winning 24 actor Kiefer Sutherland and veteran CAA Media Finance exec Roeg Sutherland. CAA confirmed the news to Deadline.\nIn some of his most well-known roles, he perfected a laconic, wry and dead-serious delivery as such characters as the cool-headed amateur murder investigator John Klute, opposite Jane Fondaâ€™s terrified, erratic call girl Bree Daniels, in Klute; as the Hawkeye Pierce in the film MASH, where he played opposite Elliott Gouldâ€™s cut-up Trapper John; and in Nicolas Reogâ€™s Donâ€™t Look Now as skeptical John Baxter, who does not believe the claims of wife Laura (Julie Christie) that their recently dead daughter is reaching out from the other side.\nIn one early change-of-pace characterization, Sutherland played a sadistic fascist in Bernardo Bertolucciâ€™s 1976 epic 1900, in which his character gleefully swings a child by the heels, bashing the boyâ€™s head against a wall.\nBorn on July 17, 1935, in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, Donald Sutherland amassed some 200 film and TV credits spanning more than 60 years, from guesting on episodes of 1960s series including Suspense, The Avengers, Court Martial and The Odd Man to last yearâ€™s Paramount+ drama Bass Reeves. His big break in movies came with Robert Aldrichâ€™s star-packed 1967 World War II drama The Dirty Dozen, playing Vernon Pinkley opposite Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, George Kennedy, Telly Savalas and others. A hit in theaters, it remains a seminal American war movie.\nHis next big role was as Capt. Benjamin Franklin â€œHawkeyeâ€ Pierce in Robert Altmanâ€™s 1970 Korean War dramedy MASH. The alternatively harrowing and hilarious film earned five Oscar nominations including Best Picture, winning for Ring Lardner Jr.â€™s biting screenplay, and fueled the 1972-83 CBS series in which Alda Alda played Hawkeye.\nSutherland followed that with another star-laden war movie, 1970â€™s Kellyâ€™s Heroes, playing Sgt. Oddball alongside Clint Eastwood, Don Rickles, Savalas and others. That led to perhaps his biggest star turn, in the 1971 Alan J. Pakula crime drama Klute. He starred opposite Fonda as New York Detective John Klute, who is hired to find a chemical company executive who has disappeared. Fonda won her first Oscar for the role, and Andy Lewis & Dave Lewis were nominated for their Original Screenplay.\nSutherlandâ€™s next big movie was Donâ€™t Look Now,\nSutherland won a Golden Globe for the television movie Path to War, an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe for his performance in the miniseries Citizen X. His extensive television credits also include The Undoing, Trust, Dirty Sexy Money, and The Pillars of the Earth, among many others.\nSutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette; sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer; daughter Rachel; and four grandchildren. A private celebration of life will be held by the family.

Iâ€™m a big mix of my background, my culture and all the opportunities my parents have given me. Theyâ€™ve been incredible and Iâ€™ve done it for them as much as Iâ€™ve done it for myself. The experience itself has been incredible and to top it off with this is just the most amazing thing, ever.â€\nMasterChef judge, John Torode, says: â€œBrin is an extraordinary cook and an amazing talent.

Today, heâ€™s delivered three absolutely sensational courses that could grace the table of any restaurant up and down the land.â€\nMasterChef judge, Gregg Wallace, commented: â€œThese are ingredient combinations that Brin is inventing.

They are great cooks and Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to be treated to amazing Tamil Sri Lankan flavours throughout my life.â€\nTalking about what drives his creativity in the kitchen, he added: â€œThe areas of cooking I love are truly an amalgamation of my Tamil Sri Lankan heritage and my British upbringing. I have a passion for creating dishes with bold flavours but refining them to high standards with European techniques. I like to pull flavour combinations from all over the world and create balanced dishes.â€\nLooking back over his time on MasterChef, Brin says: â€œMy personal highlight of the competition was the 20th anniversary dinner. Receiving a huge standing ovation from a room full of culinary royalty was one of the greatest feelings Iâ€™ve ever had. Iâ€™ve loved cooking for John and Gregg but itâ€™s been absolutely nerve racking and waiting for their feedback during tastings feels like an eternity! They are such a pleasure to cook for. No matter how stressful this competition can be, itâ€™s been fantastic. Itâ€™s been one of the greatest experiences of my life and all I know is, I have to involve cooking in my futureâ€.\nOn his next goals, Brin says: â€œIâ€™d love to have a future in the food industry. Waking up every morning knowing that Iâ€™m doing something I absolutely love would be a great feeling. It would be incredible to write a cookbook and, explore supper clubs or private dining. Longer term, Iâ€™d love food to take me all over the world. MasterChef has already given me an opportunity to cook for some of my absolute heroes â€“ including Tom Kitchin, Monica Galetti, Pierre Koffman. Iâ€™d love to do another Chefâ€™s Table for some more of the greats and see what they really think of my food! I feel like Iâ€™ve got so much more to learn and this is hopefully just the beginning.â€Â (BBC / Colombo Gazette)\n','Entertainment','2024-05-22','https://colombogazette.com/2024/05/23/british-sri-lankan-wins-uk-masterchef/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=british-sri-lankan-wins-uk-masterchef','http://colombogazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p0hzkk6r.jpg'),(8,_binary 'fŒX**T‚Å˜\Õ','Sri Lankan star Dinara Punchihewa in Forbesâ€™ 2024 30 Under 30 Asia list','Sri Lankan star Dinara Punchihewa has ben included in Forbes&#8217; 2024 30 Under 30 list for Asia.

Rithihi captures Marine Researcher Ramani Jayawardena and physiotherapist and Kuppameniya Founder Melanie Daetwyler-De Silva who are both of Swiss-Sri Lankan origin.Â  In addition, Interior Designer and multi-faceted entrepreneur Annika Fernando who has a Sri Lankan father and mother who was Dutch, Danish and Austrian with a German upbringing to realise the relevance of the Anavila story to Sri Lanka.\nAnchoring the saris on a canvas of white with the rose as the primary motif, Anavila explained the thought process behind the collection to the intimate audience gathered at the store. â€œThe idea of a summer collection danced in my head for a long time and when I went back to Puducherry 25 years later, I could see that cultural fluidity in the drape of linen saris â€“ the ease, the grace and the elegance which is very much the persona of the South Asian woman. Linen is the perfect celebration to that cross-pollination of cultures that fuse the Tamil and French way of life.â€\nEach of the saris is an opus; a legacy regaling a story of a passionate experiment blended with indigenous textiles and artisanal skill. With a desire to modernize and deconstruct the age-old sari, Ã‰TÃ‰ holds within its weaves elements of a garden in full bloom or the minute detailing of a single feature symbolic of a languid summer day.Â  As Ramani mentions, â€œGarments shouldnâ€™t necessarily represent cultural identity; they can stand alone as statements. The way Anavila drapes saris show how easily they can be perceived as Western outfits.â€\nThe piece de resistance in the Ã‰TÃ‰ collection is the ivory khadi silk sari that took a team of applique artisans and hand embroiderers 400 days to complete. The detailing is meticulous, the work exacting and the process surely exhausting, but it is an oeuvre that chronicles the entirety of how artisanal hands weave cultural identity into an ever-evolving newness.\nâ€œI believe clothing for the creator is just another outlet to funnel design and craftsmanship, and for the wearer, a means of expression,â€ says Annika, who identifies with wearing South Asian designs. â€œA designer could create a piece to communicate a point of view and the wearer may not read it or express it in the same way.â€\nMelanie perfectly captures the Anavila spirit in this collection, saying, â€œClothes have the power to express individual style while also serving to represent cultural identity. What I wear reflects this belief as I combine traditional elements with contemporary designs to showcase my appreciation for both heritage and innovation.â€','Lifestyle','2024-06-23','https://colombogazette.com/2024/06/23/rithihi-showcases-newest-collection-storied-on-the-french-tamil-influence-in-puducherry/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rithihi-showcases-newest-collection-storied-on-the-french-tamil-influence-in-puducherry','http://colombogazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Textile-Talks-Photo-5.jpg'),(1,_binary 'fŒX£*T‚Å˜\Ù','Mount Lavinia Hotel celebrates Wellness and Wellbeing with Sunset Yoga Event','In the spirit of wellness and wellbeing, Mount Lavinia Hotel is thrilled to announce a special Sunset Yoga session with Yoga Alliance Certified instructor Shabna.

Among the many variety items [&#8230;]','\nBy Sarah Hannan\nSri Lankans are taking a keen interest on expressing their solidarity with the people of Palestine since the 07 October 2023 events and recently organised an event that reflected on the first Nakba that took place on 14 May 1948 under the theme â€˜All Out for Palestineâ€™.\nAmong the many variety items that were on the days agenda was the book â€˜The Children of the Little Olive Parkâ€™Â authored by Ruwanthie de Chickera andÂ illustrated by Ryan Holsinger. The book distributed free at the event was dramatised by actors from Mind Adventures Theatre Co. and Stages Theatre Group actors.\nâ€œI wrote it in such a way that even a child could understand how the conflict was created in Palestine, and how it has been stoked throughout the years to bring about this terrible situation we are in,â€ speaking about the book de Chickera explained.\nThe illustrations done by Holsinger add aÂ greaterÂ visual impact for those who pick the book to read to children. ChildrenÂ who areÂ familiar with the colours associated with the countries could visually read the story along with it.\nWhen asked on why she decided to use a situation between children for her storytelling approach, de Chickera elaborated; â€œIn this little story, the main points of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict are set in simple language, and applied to a childrenâ€™s situation. Two groups of children fight over a small park that they both want to play in. What would any decent and sensible adult do to mediate a situation like this? If the answer is clear in this scenario, the answer in Palestine should be clear too.â€\ndeÂ Chickeraâ€™sÂ approach to explaining the complexity of an over seven-decade systematic pogrom andÂ marginalisationÂ endured by the people of Palestine isÂ simple,Â it talks about a daily occurrence of a simple interaction between two groups that have to access a public space and share resources. While on the surface level, this seems like a social engagement that will not causeÂ anyÂ conflict or create division, de Chickera unties the intricate details of how a simple behaviour of selfishness, wanting to impose authority and ownership based on access toÂ resourcesÂ could lead to disputes.\nCollaborative effort and a drama\nde Chickera fondly remembered her long term peer in theatre practice Tracy Holsinger who is the Director of Mind Adventures Theatre Co. with whom de Chickeraâ€™s Stages Theatre Group actors collaborated to stage a key moment of the story at the Public Library on 14 May 2024.\nâ€œTracy created a fantastic play. Both Mind Adventures Theatre Co. and Stages Theatre Group are local theatre companies, which have been around for 25 years now, producing original and innovative theatre on pertinent social issues. Like artists the world over, we have been horrified by the carnage in Palestine and the hypocritical brutality of powerful Western governments and global institutions set up to â€˜protectâ€™ humanity,â€ de Chickera explained.\nAdding that, â€œSince November 2023, we have been consolidating the efforts of activists in Sri Lanka in support of the global movement towards a free Palestine. We have produced poetry, music, performances, and readings in solidarity with the people of Palestine and in support to end all colonization, apartheid, genocide and hypocrisy. As artists, we will continue to lend our efforts to this global struggle for humanity.â€\nSome views from the readers of â€˜The Children of the Little Olive Parkâ€™\nCost of conflict â€“ 12-year-old Sarah\n12-year-old Sarah SurajÂ whoÂ is an avid readerÂ upon readingÂ theÂ bookÂ said that overallÂ theÂ book captures theÂ â€˜Cost ofÂ Conflictâ€™\nâ€œThe Children of the Little Olive Parkâ€Â is a storyÂ thatÂ isÂ inspiredÂ by the fight between Palestine and Israel; it talks about a crucial aspect of the conflict and creates awareness of the ongoing war. It shows us the ignorance surrounding theÂ conflict,Â andÂ how most of the world overlooks it for itsÂ convenience;Â even though many innocent livesÂ are taken away.Â  The story also tells us of the suffering endured byÂ Palestinians,Â despite their generosity to Israel. This story talks about the war through simple andÂ interestingÂ storytelling.\nâ€œThe Little Olive Parkâ€Â is more than just a story; it is a reminder of the cost of conflict. It amplifies the voices silenced by the world. I enjoyed reading this book, and I think it has a meaningful andÂ deepÂ messageÂ allÂ while being short and simple.â€\nWhy did theÂ bigÂ place people do such things? â€“ 10 year old Imaad\n10-year-old Imaad HannanÂ whoÂ read the book with his mom Tinaz AmithÂ wasÂ quite confused as to why theÂ bigÂ place people ill-treated the children living near the Little Olive Park. Amith explained that her son understood that the story was about the conflict that is taking place in Palestine, yetÂ neededÂ more information about the history of the conflict toÂ understandÂ why they needed to divide the park between the two groups.\nâ€œImaad did not understand why things were happening as in the storyÂ at first. He did not know the history of the conflict between the two countries. He knew it was aboutÂ Palestine,Â but could not understand why the big place people did such things. Once I explained the history, he understood it clearly.â€\n\nCollect a FreeÂ copy at Barefoot Bookshop, Colombo 03, Sri Lanka\nDownload the book through â€“https://archive.org/details/little-olive-park-mobile-version\n\n(Sarah Hannan is a media practitioner, consultant trainer, mentor specialising in the field of print media.

The estimated expenditure on social welfare, public health and education is around Rs. 1.5 trillion which is close to Rs. 3 trillion. The estimated income at best is about Rs. 4 trillion annually.\nThere is a surplus of about Rs. 1 trillion expenditure minus income but that is before taking into account the domestic interest costs and debt repayments which is around Rs. 2.5 trillion ending up with a Rs. 1.5 trillion deficit.\nAnd when considering the capital expenditure on top of that, which is Rs. 1 trillion there is a budget deficit of about Rs. 2.2 trillion.\nFinancing this deficit in the past was done by borrowings and printing money he said.\nTo overcome this situation the government had to indulge in difficult but necessary decisions to increase taxation to 36%, VAT to 18% and introduce tax on motor vehicles.\nThe motor industry came under prohibition. But that again there was a reason. At that time the country had exported about USD 12 billion of goods and had tourism and remittances of about USD 6 or 7 billion and from other services received about another two USD 3 billion, which added to around USD 22 billion. With this the country managed to just bridge it closely and whatever difference was borrowed from international markets.\nHowever when the country lost tourism and remittance income of USD 7-8 billion the government had to impose controls on imports and the motor industry was one of the first casualties of that.\nâ€œAlthough others have been restored, motor vehicle imports are still banned. The ban could be relaxed only when the forex space improved to an acceptable limit,â€ he added.\nThe post SL can relax ban on vehicle imports next year appeared first on DailyNews.','Business','2024-07-08','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/09/business/584016/sl-can-relax-ban-on-vehicle-imports-next-year/',NULL),(1,_binary 'fŒT„*T‚Å˜˜','SAGT to explore green hydrogen as alternative fuel','<p>Keeping true to being a leader in adapting green technology, South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) Sri Lankaâ€™s first Public Private Partnership container&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/09/business/584039/sagt-to-explore-green-hydrogen-as-alternative-fuel/\">SAGT to explore green hydrogen as alternative fuel</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk\">DailyNews</a>.</p>','Keeping true to being a leader in adapting green technology, South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) Sri Lankaâ€™s first Public Private Partnership container terminal, is exploring green hydrogen as an alternative fuel for powering terminal equipment.\nIn addition the Company also plans to electrify 30 Prime Mover Trucks (PMs) out of a fleet of 80. SAGT will also install rooftop solar that will generate approximately 7% of the current electricity usage. Due to a 7% uptick in container volumes in 2023/24 in comparison to 2022/23, SAGTâ€™s total carbon footprint increased by 8% although the GHG intensity (kgCO2eq/ box move) continued to fall and saw a marginal reduction of 0.1%. To accelerate progress towards net zero the Company will convert 6 more RTGs to hybrid technology.\nIn the year ahead, SAGT will also invest in electrification and renewable energy to power segments of its operations going forward. These were highlighted by SAGT in its fifth successive sustainability report for the period 2023/24 which was centred on the theme â€œCollaborating for Tomorrowâ€ and captures the Companyâ€™s leadership towards sustainability and presents its sustainability performance for the related period.\nThe International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has mandated the international shipping industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. As a key player within the maritime landscape SAGT is focussed on reaching net zero ahead of the IMO target. Being conscious of water usage SAGT employs a submetering network to track and reduce consumption. Further, the existing Sewer Treatment Plant (STP) is being upgraded to allow reuse of treated effluent for selected terminal activities.\nThrough a groundbreaking initiative between Maersk Line and SAGT, the Company is looking to reuse water desalinated onboard vessels. Effectively reducing SAGTâ€™s need for natural water withdrawal by approximately 2% based on one tank-tainer of 25,000 litres per week.\nSAGT will also continue to digitalise and automate its processes for heightened efficiency and more sustainable operations. During the period the Company launched phase one of a digital Safety Management System (SMS). The complete system is set to roll out in mid-2024.\nRomesh David, CEO of SAGT said â€œWe continue to strive to create a best in class, equitable and egalitarian working environment for our employees while engaging in targeted initiatives aimed at sustaining the wider community in which we operate.â€\nAmong other corporate social responsibility initiatives SAGT spent Rs. 185 million to supply 75ML of milk powder towards re-starting the stalled â€œThriposhaâ€ nutritional program of the Government.\nThe post SAGT to explore green hydrogen as alternative fuel appeared first on DailyNews.','Business','2024-07-08','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/09/business/584039/sagt-to-explore-green-hydrogen-as-alternative-fuel/',NULL),(2,_binary 'fŒT„*T‚Å˜™','Hayleys Solar selected for first ADB-developed, financed, agrivoltaics project in Sri Lanka','<p>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) together with the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SEA) under the Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE),&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/09/business/584043/hayleys-solar-selected-for-first-adb-developed-financed-agrivoltaics-project-in-sri-lanka/\">Hayleys Solar selected for first ADB-developed, financed, agrivoltaics project in Sri Lanka</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk\">DailyNews</a>.</p>','The Asian Development Bank (ADB) together with the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SEA) under the Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE), the Tea Smallholders Development Authority (TSHDA) under the Ministry of Plantation Industries (MOPI), the University of Peradeniya and Hayleys Solar inaugurated Sri Lankaâ€™s first-ever semi-transparent Solar PV-powered Agrivoltaics Demonstration Project.\nAgrivoltaics are built on the innovative practice of installing solar panels above lands suitable for growing crops. The key innovation in the ADB-developed project, implemented in Hanthana â€“ Kandy, lies in transparent solar panels, allowing sunlight to reach crops while generating clean energy, and maximising land use efficiency. This initiative marks a significant milestone for the countryâ€™s clean energy and agricultural industries.\nThe 85kWp hybrid semi-transparent solar panel project, operational since February 29, 2024, installed two metres above the tea plantation at the Hanthana Ratnasiri Wickramanayake National Training Centre, Kandy is projected to generate electricity to power 19 households, contributing to the national grid with a 24 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery energy storage system.\nThe project complements the tea plants with a strategically placed LED lighting system above, creating a controlled environment for optimal growth.These LED lights leverage solar power efficiently by utilising targeted spectrums beneficial to tea plants, consuming less energy for sustainable operation, and emitting minimal heat to maintain ideal growing temperatures â€“ all contributing to increased yields without burdening the local grid.\nThe facility also complements a groundwater pump with a borehole arrangement to facilitate water supply for both the tea plants at the project area and the nearby estate community.\nâ€œThis project has the opportunity to address both issues of achieving energy security and overcoming agricultural challenges in a land-stressed country like Sri Lanka,â€ said Professor Janaka Ekanayake, Senior Professor from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Peradeniya.\nâ€œProjects such as this are being implemented around the world, and this is the first time Sri Lanka has undertaken an initiative.â€\nProfessor Ekanayake also highlighted the potential for expanding this technology to other crops like vanilla, tomato, and bell pepper cultivations as well. The project, based on an 800-square-metre tea estate, is expected to generate well above 100 MWh of electricity annually.Ranjith Sepala, Chairman of SLSEA and Dr. Sulakshana Jayawardena, Secretary to MOPE said, â€œThis initiative has the potential to revolutionise the way we use our land resources for both food and energy production, and it is a perfect example of how innovation can solve multiple societal challenges.â€\nHayleys Solar, the renewable energy arm of Hayleys Fentons, was selected for the supply and installation through a competitive bid to build the Agrivoltaics Demonstration Project.\nState Minister of Plantation Industries, Lohan Ratwatte stated, â€œthis project marks a significant stride towards sustainable development in our agricultural sector.\nThe increasing demand for food and energy in Sri Lanka, coupled with the challenges of fossil fuel-based electricity, highlights the importance of renewable energy.â€\nProf. Priyantha Wijayatunga, Senior Director, Energy, ADB, said, â€œAgrivoltaics offer a unique opportunity to address energy security in a land-constrained country like Sri Lanka and its agricultural challenges.

Since 2006 SLIC has triumphed in declaring the highest Life Insurance bonuses year on year in the industry which now more than a massive Rs. 104 Billion making the SLIC bonus declaration unmatchable.\nBy declaring the highest and largest ever Life Insurance Bonus in the country, Sri Lanka Insurance Life has upheld the trust placed by the policyholders as the strongest insurance provider in Sri Lanka. Despite internal changes and the economic and social impact felt by the company. Sri Lanka Insurance Life was able to increase its asset base to Rs. 221 Billion and the life fund to Rs. 180.8 Billion, to further strengthen its position as the largest and strongest local insurer. Furthermore, the monthly average Life Insurance claim settlement exceeds Rs. 1 Billion amounting to around Rs. 12 Billion annually in addition to the annual bonus declaration. This affirms the prudent investment management strategies of the company and further emphasis on Sri Lanka Insuranceâ€™s commitment towards its policyholders and their well-being.\nChandana L. Aluthgama Group CEO of Sri Lanka Insurance Life, officially declaring the bonus value for the year 2023\nPresident Counsel Ronald C. Perera Chairman of Sri Lanka Insurance Life addressing the gathering\nThe official bonus deceleration event was held at a special event at Nuwara Eliya in the presence of the corporate management, regional management, sales team and customers on the 6th of July 2024. The Group Chief Executive Officer of Sri Lanka Insurance Life Mr. Chandana L Aluthgama officially announced bonus value for the year 2023, which was followed by the launch of the communication campaign of the bonus declaration.\nReflecting on this significant milestone, Mr. Chandana L Aluthgama Group Chief Executive Officer of Sri Lanka Insurance Life stated, â€˜we are a company with a legacy of 60 years and we have stood by our customers at all times and kept our promise. Despite various challenges, we have remained steadfast in our mission to prioritise the well-being of our customers. The companyâ€™s prudent management strategies and positive approach towards the growth of the business has earned us great results for the year 2023. Our commitment towards our policyholders have always been our priority and Rs. 11.2 Billion bonus declaration is a result this very commitment.â€™ He said.\nChairman of Sri Lanka Insurance Life President Counsel Mr. Ronald C Perera stated, â€˜Our ability to declare an enormous Rs. 11.2 Billion bonus for our policyholders underscores SLIC Lifeâ€™s financial strength and resilience as a company.â€™ He also emphasized on the fact that this is the largest sum of money an individual company has declared as bonus in the country for its customers and no organization in the country has been able to achieve such a milestone. This achievement sets Sri Lanka Insurance Life apart in the corporate sector, demonstrating its unwavering commitment to delivering on our promises and standing strong as a leader in the industry.\nCustomer centricity is one of the key strategic pillars of SLICâ€™s business drive and therefore the organsiation is determined to look at identifying new market segment and understanding the needs of its customers to develop affordable and suitable products. â€˜Wealth Plusâ€™, a short-term investment plan with long-term protection, now enhanced with flexible payment term options was launched for greater customer convenience. In addition to engaging in product and process innovations the organisation also looks at numerous ways of value additions to its customers. As a result, Sri Lanka Insurance has continuously upgraded its Life Loyalty Rewards scheme enabling SLIC Life customers to enjoy a range of offers and benefits to provide higher value for its loyal customers throughout the policy term.\nFurthermore, Educating the Sri Lankan people about the importance of Life Insurance is an aspect Sri Lanka Insurance Life holds close to its heart from the inception of its existence.

SLICLL introduced its first online life insurance product, Early Cash Online, which offers an end-to-end digital experience, allowing customers to customize their policies conveniently and transparently affirming its commitment to putting customers first.\nRecently Sri Lanka Insurance Life was also awarded the â€˜The Most Loved Life Insurance Brandâ€™ by LMD for the seventh consecutive year. This validate the impact Sri Lanka Insurance as a brand has on the people of this country, its strong presence in the market and the brands ability to demonstrate greater empathy towards the people of this country.\nThe recent segregation of Sri Lanka Insurance as Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Life Limited (SLICLL)and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation General Limited (SLICGL) foresee new opportunities for growth and success. The legal segregation has allowed for a more focused execution of Sri Lanka Insurance Lifeâ€™s business strategies, ensuring enhanced efficiency and effectiveness in serving its customers. SLICLL remains steadfast in their commitment to superior customer service. The essence of its business drive for 2024, â€˜Customer centricity through focused specialisation,â€™ remains unchanged.\nSLIC Life continues to explore avenues to provide protection to communities, segments and age groups and different affinity groups through product and market development initiatives, through practical and affordable insurance solutions.

Teacher trade unions too were set to stage a strike today (Tuesday) over the same demand, although it was only recently that they received a substantial pay hike. As State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya correctly stated, the Government was unable to meet such a demand for want of adequate finances, adding that the Government had already granted all possible benefits to state sector employees and wanted them to say how it (Government) could find the money for granting the demand. Had anyone got an answer, he was willing to discuss such a proposal. It was only the other day that President Ranil Wickremesinghe warned the teachers that he would be forced to take stringent measures if they continue to resort to strikes, observing that teachers should be inside the classrooms and not on the roads. Childrenâ€™s future could not be allowed to be jeopardized by teacher strikes, he added.\nIn fact, the Government should consider drastic steps to end what has now become routine trade union action across all sectors, causing immense damage to the economy, not to mention the distress caused to the public. There are 1.4 million public sector employees in the country and, as pointed out by State Minister Siyambalapitiya, it is well-nigh impossible to grant such a demand without making the country go bankrupt. Teachers, above all else, should understand this reality, particularly at a time when the economy is just about coming out of the woods. They (teachers) too have children who are schooling, and wonâ€™t this continuing spate of strikes by them affect their children as well? The President should lose no time in putting into true effect the Essential Services (ES) decree and punish all trade union leaders who are pulling their members out of work in the Government service. In fact, we feel that the reluctance on the part of the authorities to act in terms of ES by dismissing strikers is the main cause that has emboldened them to continue striking, with no let or hindrance. Had the authorities made examples of a few striking TU members before this, things would not have descended to this level. At least now they (authorities) should open their eyes and get tough. If not, the same pattern is going to follow until the economy collapses totally.\nThere is little doubt that the JVP and the Frontline Peopleâ€™s Party are responsible for inciting these strikes. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who, one day, hopes to become the countryâ€™s leader, would not want to take over an economically collapsed state. At least this factor should compel him to desist from bringing the workers onto the streets even at this late stage. Strikes should be resorted to only when negotiations fail and as a last resort. On the contrary, today strikes are being called at the drop of a hat. How can the state machinery function under such circumstances? Wonâ€™t this result in confusion and chaos all around? Such a state of affairs must be put to an end with a firm hand. The law should be implemented to the fullest and the police called upon to get tougher in dealing with striking workers. What happens at present is that the Police are reduced to mere bystanders and are even shown on TV getting into light conversation with the culprits. No doubt, all this has made the strikers lose whatever inhibitions to act as they do at present.\nProlonged strikes have today become a way of life in this country, affecting all sectors including tourism. Recently, TV showed a group of tourists waving their train tickets at the cameras near the Fort Railway station, indicating their helplessness and frustration at being unable to make their train trip to the hill country due to a rail strike. It is doubtful if these tourists would ever visit this country again. Not just the touristsâ€”how about prospective foreign investors? Would they be willing to park their money in a country where the workforce is constantly on the streets? Little wonder it was recently reported that some investors have taken their businesses to countries such as Malaysia and the Maldives. The Government must also ascertain if the stepped-up strike action has anything to do with the upcoming Presidential Election with a view to making the Government unpopular. This is because the strikes cause inconvenience and harassment to the general public, who invariably vent their anger on the Government. That is why it is necessary to ascertain if there are political parties behind the current spate of strikes in order to make political headway in this fashion. If necessary, laws should be brought in to punish these political inciters. Even during the time of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, left political parties continually organised strikes, particularly in the ports, in order to deprive people of food supplies and invite their wrath on the authorities. A similar move could not be ruled out even at present. It is well known that certain left-leaning political parties are masters at creating disaffection among the public with the Government in power. Organising strikes is a surefire way of achieving this end, going by experience. Those using strikes as a convenient political tool should be punished under the law.\nThe post Strikes as a political tool? appeared first on DailyNews.','Editorial','2024-07-08','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/09/editorial/584203/strikes-as-a-political-tool/',NULL),(1,_binary 'fŒU\ï*T‚Å˜®','Education should not be disturbed or delayed','<p>It is very interesting to check the current situation of some of the present day schoolteachers who teach at state schools.

They are more interested in everything else than teaching. Even when they teach, they teach children about the importance of doing Aragalaya and the hardships they face justifying their trade union actions. Most of the time they do this through various WhatsApp groups of children created for study purposes. Now they have become brave enough to do it in live classrooms in state schools. Those are their interests. They are not interested in teaching which they get paid.\nLast week President Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed that no one would be permitted to disrupt school education between 7.30 am and 1.30 pm and he has directed the Attorney General to consider further measures to ensure this. â€œIt is imperative that the education of children is not hindered by school closures or strikes. Our actions must be taken with future generations in mindâ€, he added. Present day teachers are only worried about their private tuition classes.\nSometimes they punish or ignore poor students who do not attend their private tuition classes. The best part is not any of those. They never teach in schools during school time. They do their own work or just rest in the `staff roomâ€™ chatting with other teachers. Most of the teachers just read the lesson and put the answers for questions on the black / white board. This practice becomes a tragedy when it comes to teaching Mathematics. The other major issue is that the majority of teachers only teach the good (talented) students while totally ignoring all the other students who have average ability and are weak.\nIn state schools, the students are rarely allowed to ask questions and get things clarified when they face difficulties while learning. Asking questions is treated as â€˜going against the teacherâ€™ or â€˜putting the teacher in a difficult situationâ€™. Some students were promoted to the next grade without teaching them how to read and write! They reach Grade Ten without knowing how to read and write. Only schoolchildren in all Provinces except North and East are affected by teachersâ€™ strikes. Others and International and private school children are NOT affected at all. It is poor schoolchildren at the receiving end.\nIt is good that at least schoolteachers can prevent such schoolchildren from becoming criminals. To do this the teachers should understand that their service is `sacredâ€™ and NOT just another job done for the monthly salary. They can very easily learn this from retired (aged) schoolteachers. No matter what, Sri Lankan adults respect their schoolteachers. They do especially after finishing schooling and becoming adults. They bow down and worship their school teachers even on public roads ! That era is no more.\nLate last year it was reported that around 6000 students failed all subjects in the Ordinary Level Examination. They were not idiots. They had not been given required knowledge by teachers. But some teachers are good at one thing. That is using schoolchildrenâ€™s personal details (their parentsâ€™ jobs, casts, financial status, religions etc) when scolding them for minor offences. Those schoolteachers cannot be named as school. Their formal attire is extremely pathetic. They wear sarees to school but those so-called sarees are more like bikinis! They expose every possible part of their bodies through the saree. They think that the school is a fashion show ramp and schoolchildren are the audience!\nPresent day teachers try their best to get anything and everything from schoolchildren. Gifts, money, etc are among those things but the list does not end there. The list ends with sexual satisfaction. It is not only male teachers and principals. It is the same with female schoolteachers. Maybe still Sri Lankan people remember how an old female schoolteacher from Horana area sexually abused a young schoolboy at his own home. Several years ago another female schoolteacher eloped with a 15-years-old school boy and was found from Nuwara Eliya by the Police after a few days.\nNow the time has come for the teachersâ€™ trade unions to stop all strikes and find out their own members who exploit schoolchildren. Maybe they can establish a mechanism to trace them, investigate them and punish them. But detecting, investigating and punishing the culprits should not be similar to doing it in the health sector! In the health sector, at the end of any investigation, there are no culprits and therefore no punishments. It is similar to asking who the robber is from the mother of the thief!\nIt is very important for any human being to achieve whatever he/she wants without wasting any time. Wasting even one second from a childâ€™s life is a crime. It is a crime because we cannot turn back our biological clock. We cannot take back the time wasted. All individuals and groups who committed this crime should be punished by law. Crocodile tears of teachersâ€™ trade unions are not useful for schoolchildren.\nÂ \nThe post Education should not be disturbed or delayed appeared first on DailyNews.','Editorial','2024-07-07','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/08/editorial/583386/education-should-not-be-disturbed-or-delayed/',NULL),(2,_binary 'fŒU\ï*T‚Å˜¯','A new era for the UK','<p>Change Begins.

Those were the two words that Sir Keir Starmer highlighted on the podium following the spectacular landslide victory of his Labour Party at the British elections after 14 tumultuous years of Conservative rule. Rishi Sunak, the first Prime Minister of Colour in the UK, not only conceded defeat but also accepted responsibility for it. It is also a rare victory for a Left-leaning party in a world that is increasingly turning to the Hard Right.\nFormer Crown Prosecutor Starmer, as Prime Minister, will have to lead a country that is a vestige of what it was even 10 years ago thanks to the self-inflicted wound of Brexit. It was also a personal victory for Starmer, who entered politics in 2015 and assumed Labour leadership after a disastrous spell by Jeremy Corbyn, perceived as a hard Leftist. Starmer is known as a Centrist with a penchant for a balanced approach to the many troubles plaguing the Union.\nChange cannot come soon enough for the voters who have been fed up with a string of disastrous policy failures by five Conservative Prime Ministers, including Boris â€œPartygateâ€ Johnson and Liz Truss, who governed for just 49 days, the shortest stint of any British Premier.\nThough widely expected, the scale of Labourâ€™s victory was simply overwhelming. While Labour gained more than 410 Seats in Britainâ€™s First-Past-the-Post (FPP) voting system, the Conservatives were reduced to less than 120 Seats (at the time of writing). This was their worst defeat in living memory, with 250 Conservative Seats being lost, including all Seats in Wales. Liberal Democrats also had a strong showing, winning more than 70 Seats, up from the 11 they previously held. The Scottish National Party (SNP) won less than 10 Seats, but in a way, the biggest winner was arch Brexiteer Nigel Farageâ€™s Reform UK, which went from Zero to four Seats, with Farage himself entering Parliament on his eighth attempt from Clacton, Essex, beating the Conservatives.\nBut Brexit itself was hardly under discussion during the run-up to the poll, with voters more or less resigned to their fate. Starmer is however expected to renegotiate some of the more restrictive terms of the Brexit deal, stopping short of rejoining the EU Single Market or Customs Union. On the other hand, immigration, one of the main topics that led to Brexit, was very much in play. Sunakâ€™s â€œStop the Boatsâ€ campaign fell flat and the cruel Rwanda repatriation plan was dead on arrival, with Starmer having already pledged to abolish it. Starmer has promised to deal with illegal immigration in a more humane manner, while rethinking some of the more controversial decisions of the Home Office (tainted forever by the Windrush scandal) with regard to legal immigration, including visas for foreign students.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg facing Starmer. He will have to rejuvenate an economy that has hardly grown for years, only to be battered further by Covid, Brexit and a huge debt burden. Starmer might have to resort to tax hikes or welfare cuts, however unpalatable they may be, to fix the economy. Unemployment is at an all-time high, with 6.7 million people receiving Universal Credit, a sort of a handout. There is also a chronic housing shortage, exacerbated by rising homelessness. The National Health Service (NHS), once the pride of the UK, is crumbling with ambulance wait times stretching to several hours and even critically ill patients having to wait outside hospitals. A strike by junior doctors has also not helped.\nMost Local Government authorities have gone bankrupt and are unable to repair the crumbling infrastructure facilities. Starmer will also have to decide the future of the proposed HS2 High Speed Rail project, which is running over budget and also the third runway for Heathrow. The proposed acquisition of Royal Mail by a foreign company could also pose a headache for Starmer, as Labour has traditionally not favoured privatization.\nNot much is expected to change on the foreign affairs front, with Starmer having already pledged support for NATO and Ukraine in the war against Russia. Starmer may choose to tread a more cautious path on the Gaza War as he has consistently voiced support for a Palestinian State, while stressing that it cannot happen unilaterally or in a vacuum without going through the due process. Nevertheless, the UK is expected to remain a strong ally of Israel under Starmer. Closer home, it will be interesting to see how Starmer deals with France, where a Far-Right Premier is certain to come to power after the second round of elections on July 7. Emmanuel Macron will still be President, but it will be an uneasy cohabitation that could have serious implications for the EU and the UK.\nAcross the pond, developments are even more worrying as there is a real possibility of Donald Trump reclaiming the White House in November, especially after President Joe Bidenâ€™s faltering performance at the first CNN debate. Starmer, on his part, has reassured voters that the UK-US relationship is above personalities. Indeed, in Starmer, the UK may have found the perfect antidote for toxic politics that bedevil much of the world.\nThe post A new era for the UK appeared first on DailyNews.','Editorial','2024-07-05','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/06/editorial/582662/a-new-era-for-the-uk/',NULL),(3,_binary 'fŒU\ï*T‚Å˜°','A good move','<p>Todayâ€™s topic is relevant for the entire population, especially the ordinary people above the age of 50 or 60, who suffer from&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/05/editorial/582119/a-good-move/\">A good move</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk\">DailyNews</a>.</p>','Todayâ€™s topic is relevant for the entire population, especially the ordinary people above the age of 50 or 60, who suffer from Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and all the other illnesses. For some individuals medications matter more than food and they are on certain medications for the rest of their lives. Only the people who suffer some type of disease know the value of reducing sky high prices of drugs. There should be transparency and fairness in the pricing of locally produced and imported pharmaceuticals.\nThe National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Act, No. 5 of 2015, was amended and the gazette notification related to the matter was also published in order to introduce a price mechanism to determine the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of medicinal drugs. The initiative had been taken to ensure fairness and transparency in pharmaceutical pricing.\nA method was introduced to determine the MRP of a particular drug, considering its dosage, form and strength. Accordingly, regulations were issued to be cited as the â€œMedicines (Pricing Mechanism for determination of MRP for a dosage, form and strength of a particular medicine) Regulations, No. 1 of 2024.â€\nThe MRP of a dosage, form and strength of a particular medicine â€œshould be determined by using an internationally recognised information portal for identifying the market share by value of different brands or Generic Names of drug formulations. The MRP would be determined by verifying the retail costs of the relevant dosage, form and strength of a particular medicine from retail pharmacies in different parts of the island and information provided by the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC).\nThe prices of almost all medications, especially the medications used by people who suffer from NCDs skyrocketed along with the depreciation of the Rupee against the Dollar and even rich people could not afford to buy medications from private pharmacies after the gravest ever financial crisis hit Sri Lanka in 2022. The ordinary people suffered a lot for about two years without being able to buy medications.\nSome people totally gave up buying the medications prescribed to them by their physicians and some people reduced the number of times they take their regular medications. For example they stopped taking their prescribed medications daily and they took those medications every other day. Some started to use the medications only when they feel sick and some started to use medications only when they have some money to buy those expensive medications.\nIt was the countryâ€™s workforce which was severely affected by all those practices. The overall health of the country was at risk. Some poor people even started to use Ayurvedic or herbal medications after giving up extremely expensive Western medications prescribed for them. They did it because they did not have any other option after meeting all the other requirements of their families, especially their childrenâ€™s food requirements etc.\nThis situation made peopleâ€™s health worse because they were very worried without being able to buy essential medications that control their diseases and save their lives. No one likes to stop using medications without his/her Physicianâ€™s instructions because almost everyone knows that it is not safe. Only the people who use at least one or two medications regularly for their illnesses know the plight of not being able to buy medications and healthy people who do not use any medications do not understand this silent suffering.\nWith measures taken in June 2023 and yesterday to reduce prices of drugs, all the people who can afford will buy their regular medications from pharmacies without seeking the service of State hospitals where they can receive their regular drugs free of charge. Usually no one likes to go to clinics in State hospitals and wait in queues for hours in order to obtain their medications. Therefore, people who have some money in their hands will buy their medications from the private sector.\nBut in the past even the people who worked in the private sector and earned a reasonable salary did not have adequate money to buy their regular medications because they had to pay over Rs. 10,000 to buy medications they need just for one week. Before the financial crisis they just paid around Rs. 1,000 for the same amount of medications.\nThe prices of several medicines were revised by way of an extraordinary gazette issued in June 2023 enabling people to buy drugs for lower prices. Accordingly, the prices of 60 medicines were reduced by 16 percent as per the relevant gazette. Insulin, Thyroxin, Olanzapine are among the drugs subjected to the MRP reduction of 16 percent.\nThe introduction of maximum prices for certain medications such as Insulin and Thyroxin was very significant because a large number of people use them. A large number of people, especially those above 40 use Thyroxin which is an essential hormone because unlike in the past a significant portion of the population suffer from hormonal deficiencies. The health authorities should also tame the private health sector, especially private hospitals which still charge sky-high prices for diagnostic tests, medications and in-patient treatment. A uniform pricing policy should be introduced at least for the diagnostic and radiological tests.\nThe post A good move appeared first on DailyNews.','Editorial','2024-07-04','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/05/editorial/582119/a-good-move/',NULL),(4,_binary 'fŒUğ*T‚Å˜±','An irreplaceable Tamil Leader','<p>The passing away of Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader R.

Sampanthan, removes from our midst a rare moderate Tamil political leader who was against the division of the country in any form, though a firm advocate of devolution as the answer to the National Question. His loss has certainly created a huge void not only in the Tamil Political firmament but also in national politics. The positions he always took cut across the ethnic divide and encompassed the larger Sri Lankan community.\nThe accolades showered on him by political leaders of all hues bear this out in ample measure. The condolence message from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also a testament to the respect and honour foreign leaders accorded him. President Ranil Wickremesinghe was among those who expressed their grief at the passing away of the veteran Tamil political leader.\nIn his special condolence message, the President noted that notwithstanding representing the TULF and the TNA, the former Opposition Leader consistently upheld Sri Lankaâ€™s territorial integrity. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa too was deeply saddened by the demise of Sampanthan, a personal friend, saying that his death was a loss not only to Tamil politics but also to the nation itself.\nThe late Sampanthan was an eloquent Parliamentarian who spoke from the heart articulating his views in a candid manner. Many Parliament reporters, instead of taking down his speech, simply listened to him which indeed was a pleasant experience. He never referred to any written script and was a master of repartee. He boldly expressed his views not only concerning Tamils in the North but also touching on national issues and advocating justice for Sinhala and Muslim communities for any perceived injustice.\nPerhaps, this could be one of reasons which endeared him so much to politicians of the South, even those hardliners as demonstrated by their expression of condolences and presence to pay their last respects. Having his education in two schools in the South may also be one of the reasons for his affinity with the majority Sinhalese to the extent of standing on behalf of their interests.\nR. Sampanthan was a firm advocate for the implementation of the 13th Amendment as the best answer for devolution and consistently expressed his views in this respect both within and outside Parliament. It is indeed sad that he had to pass away at this time when the President and the Opposition Leader both expressed the intention to fully implement the 13th Amendment. He would certainly have been the happiest had he been alive. It would have been the culmination of his long cherished dream.\nHe held on to the conviction that the 13th Amendment would be the ultimate solution even at a time the LTTE rejected such a move in toto and even killed pro-13A Tamil politicians. This was at a time that all Tamil Politicians of the North were compelled to toe the line of the Tigers. His indeed was a tightrope walk.\nHe never wavered in his commitment to serve the interests of the Tamil community who looked up to him to promote their causes. He was, indeed, a leader who could inspire confidence in all who came in touch with him. Entering Politics as a youth in the 1950s his service to his community during these long years was reciprocated time and again by being repeatedly elected to Parliament from his Trincomalee constituency.\nWhatever the provocation no MP retaliated when Sampanthan was on his feet in the House. Even the Speaker always acceded to his request for additional time out of respect for him. His calm and collected demeanour won for him many friends in Parliament. It would not be wrong to say that he was treated differently to other MPs by all Members, perhaps, because of his calm composure.\nIt would not be an exaggeration to state that Tamil politics would not be the same again without Sampanthan. He acted as a calming influence against militant MPs from the North. As the Opposition Leader from 2015 to 2018 he held himself exceptionally well and performed the duties attached to that office with skill and responsibility. This, in a way, cast him in the role of a national leader since his duties as Leader of the Opposition transcended his interests only in the Tamil community of the North and the East whom he represented.\nThe best tribute all politicians of the North and the East could pay the late Sampanthan is to follow in his footsteps of moderation in outlook with regard to the National Question. The late politician shunned all forms of extremism even though this would not have endeared him much to those militant elements among his community who advocated separatism. Sampanthan spoke and conducted himself realistically. On this occasion it would be worth recalling a conversation he had with President Wickremesinghe as told by the latter in his condolence message.â€ â€œRanil do you think I would ever advocate for dividing our country? I witnessed our Independence in 1948 as a childâ€. This just about sums up the man and what indeed he stood for as a Sri Lankan.\nThe post An irreplaceable Tamil Leader appeared first on DailyNews.','Editorial','2024-07-03','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/04/editorial/581388/an-irreplaceable-tamil-leader/',NULL),(5,_binary 'fŒUğ*T‚Å˜²','Teaching Profession hits a New Low','<p>Government teachers and principals who have so far been staging street demonstrations over their salary demands have taken their protests to a&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/03/editorial/580704/teaching-profession-hits-a-new-low/\">Teaching Profession hits a New Low</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk\">DailyNews</a>.</p>','Government teachers and principals who have so far been staging street demonstrations over their salary demands have taken their protests to a new levelâ€”doing so opposite schools where they earn their keep, thus reaching a new low in their continuing shameful and unacceptable conduct unbecoming of a noble profession.\nThe teacher-principal trade union members yesterday were shown carrying black flags and banners opposite schools, shouting slogans demanding redress for their grievances. They are also planning to co-opt parents to join their protest campaign by taking up cudgels with the Government over alleged financial burdens placed on parents, in a clear bid to mobilize the parents to side with them (teachers) in order to win their salary demands.\nGeneral Secretary of the Ceylon Teachersâ€™ Services Union (CTSU) Mahinda Jayasinghe said the teachers and principals had held their demonstrations after school hours. However, he had failed to grasp the moral and ethical aspect of the whole issue. Here, we have a group of teachers, teaching at the same schools for a living, turning their backs on this very fact, falling prey to greed by staging demonstrations in front of the very schools they teach. What message are they hoping to convey to the public, particularly the parents? Above all, what implications is their act going to have on the conduct of the very students whom they are not only responsible for educating but also providing with the necessary guidance and character building to one day be productive and responsible citizens of this country? Are we going to witness a scenario where the students too very soon are going to stage demonstrations in front of their schools at the drop of a hat? Who can blame them when their own mentors and guardians have shown them the way? What, pray, is going to happen to discipline, which is a paramount feature in school life? How are the education authorities going to respond to this state of affairs? Will this not cause the collapse of the whole edifice of the education sector; what with teachers not only absenting themselves from schools to stage demonstrations but also laying siege on the very schools that provide them with their livelihoods? Where do we go from here?\nMeanwhile, parents should not allow themselves to be used in this fashion by the teachers who are only driven by political motives, as could be seen by the identity of the leaders of the teacher strikes. They have no interest whatsoever in the future of the student population. We say this because strikes by the teaching community were unheard of in the past. They (teachers) worked devotedly to ensure a bright future for their charges and were even willing to work for low salaries. This attitude won for them the respect and regard of all citizens who even went to the teachers for advice and counsel. The teachers and principals were held in such high esteem. What a contrast with the present, where the teaching community, as a whole, has lowered itself to the level of a run-of-the-mill trade union. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the other day, declared that he was going to make the teaching profession an essential service. Teachers who boycott school should be sacked and replacements found to fill in the breach. Students cannot be allowed to be held to ransom in this manner. Teachers have already received one-third of their promised 30 percent salary hike. They should wait until the economy has turned healthy for the remainder. Giving teachers a pay hike at this moment is certainly going to open the floodgates with a whole host of state sector bodies clamoring for salary hikes, which will send the economy into a tailspin and cause a setback in the progress that is being achieved.\nThere is no gainsaying that the teachers have brought disgrace to this once noble profession by their unseemly conduct. It is now left to the few teachers who are above board to try and restore the prestige of their profession, which has been dealt a body blow by the behaviour and conduct of their fellow colleagues. The Government, for its part, should bring in laws to ban all teachersâ€™ trade unions, which are nothing but appendages of politically driven trade unions in other sectors. Teachers should demonstrate by example that they deserve all demands they make by first devoting their time and energies to the development and advancement of the student population. We say this because, as already mentioned, teachers hold a special place in society not only for their education and erudition but also for their role as guiding lights to the younger generation. In their hands lay the future of the young, and they should strive to reflect this through their conduct. They (teachers) cannot be unaware that the economic crisis has exerted extreme difficulties on the Government in managing its finances, and cost-cutting even in vital sectors is being resorted to, not forgetting the poor relief programmes it has launched to cater to the vulnerable sections. Government has also to adhere to the conditions stipulated by the IMF for receiving assistance, the chief of which is pruning down Government expenditure. Across-the-board pay hikes, therefore, are not an option at this stage.\nThe post Teaching Profession hits a New Low appeared first on DailyNews.','Editorial','2024-07-02','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/03/editorial/580704/teaching-profession-hits-a-new-low/',NULL),(6,_binary 'fŒUğ*T‚Å˜³','Turning the Tide','<p>Recently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe succinctly outlined the events in Sri Lanka from March 2022 to June 2024, stating, â€œI have safely brought&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/02/editorial/579815/turning-the-tide/\">Turning the Tide</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk\">DailyNews</a>.</p>','Recently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe succinctly outlined the events in Sri Lanka from March 2022 to June 2024, stating, â€œI have safely brought the Titanic, entrusted to me, to port. While other captains fled from the iceberg, we faced a critical decision: sink or navigate to safety. Now that weâ€™ve reached port, the question is what to do next with this ship. We must decide whether to refurbish it for the next 50-100 years or hand it over in its current state to a fleeing captain.â€\nRegarding the implementation of external debt restructuring agreements, President Wickremesinghe will make a special statement to Parliament today. The debate on the Resolution for the Implementation of External Debt Restructuring Agreements will commence at 9:30 am and continue until 5:00 pm today and tomorrow. The parliamentary vote on this resolution is scheduled for 5:00 pm tomorrow.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe also announced that Sri Lanka will seek parliamentary approval for these agreements on July 2. These agreements allow Sri Lanka to defer repayment to its bilateral creditors until 2028 and extend the repayment period up to 2043.\nThe finalisation of these deals was a crucial condition set by the IMF under a $2.9 billion bailout program signed in March 2023. This programme has been instrumental in helping Sri Lanka tame inflation, stabilise its currency, and improve government finances. Projections indicate that Sri Lankaâ€™s economy is poised to grow by 3% in 2024, rebounding from a 2.3% contraction the previous year.\nThe approval of the resolution for the Implementation of External Debt Restructuring Agreements now rests with the 225 parliamentarians elected by the people of Sri Lanka. It is imperative that they vote in accordance with the wishes of their constituents rather than the directives of party leaders. It has become evident that while the Sri Lankan people desire one outcome, the political party leadership often leans towards the opposite.\nSri Lankans typically have a sharp memory for hardships endured, such as the queues and shortages experienced in 2022. They remember vividly who stood up for them during those challenging times. This collective memory influences their decisions, often prioritising practical experience over rhetoric.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe has not just spoken but has acted decisively. His courageous decisions, despite harsh criticism, have significantly reduced the cost of living, with prices of essentials like fuel, gas, and electricity plummeting. This tangible relief resonates deeply with the populace, who are inclined to support leadership that delivers on promises.\nHowever, manoeuvring the political landscape in this land is a complex affair. Entrenched interests often resist change. Despite the positive momentum, challenges remain. It reflects the nationâ€™s tumultuous journey.\nThe deterioration of the shipâ€™s condition was orchestrated by pirates who continually attacked and plundered it over time. Unable to seize the ship directly due to its strength, the pirates resorted to tactics like using so-called â€œtrade unionistsâ€ and a disruptive process called â€œAragalayaâ€ to weaken it. They also propagated falsehoods and undermined every captain who took command, leading many to capitulate to their schemes. However, the people have grown weary of these tactics and strongly oppose the pirates.\nAs of May 2024, Sri Lankaâ€™s Gross Official Reserves stood at USD 5.4 billion, marking a significant increase of over USD 1 billion from the previous year-end. Based on inflation forecasts, average consumer price inflation is projected to be 3.1% in 2024 and 2.0% in 2025, a notable decrease from 4.06% in 2023 and 9.59% in 2022. The Sri Lankan Rupee is anticipated to strengthen against the US Dollar by the end of 2024, with the LKR/USD rate expected to reach $0.003112. Furthermore, the interest rate, which peaked at 28% in 2023, has now dropped to a single-digit figure.\nDespite a 3.7% budget primary deficit in 2022, Sri Lanka achieved a remarkable turnaround in 2023, achieving a primary budget surplus. This achievement, the sixth instance in the 76 years since independence, is a significant milestone. In 2022, the balance of payments deficit was 1.9% of GDP, but by the end of 2023, the country managed to achieve a surplus, a feat not seen since 1977.\nMoreover, the governmentâ€™s 52 main statutory bodies, which faced a loss of Rs. 745 billion by the end of 2022, turned a profit of Rs. 313 billion by September 2023, surpassing expectations. The people eagerly await the storm in October, ready to entrust the ship to the captain who saved it from turmoil and uncertainty.\nThe post Turning the Tide appeared first on DailyNews.','Editorial','2024-07-01','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/02/editorial/579815/turning-the-tide/',NULL),(7,_binary 'fŒUñ*T‚Å˜´','Resolve pension anomalies','<p>P ublic Servants serve the country for several decades and then retire.

A pension paid to them recognizing their service rendered to the country. But what if someone obtains his/her motherâ€™s/fatherâ€™s or both parentsâ€™ pension(s) illegally? It is not acceptable at all.\nLast week, the media reported that over 6,400 Sri Lankans obtain illegal pensions of other individuals. The information was revealed during a recent COPE meeting. Another revelation was that an individual had obtained nearly 2.7 million as pension payments from 2013 to 2016 and it was the two pensions of that specific individualâ€™s dead parents. Most of the additional pensions had been paid to various individuals connected to the Armed Forces.\nSri Lankan public servants receive pensions for the service they rendered to the country. They serve for low salaries when compared with other countries in the world and then retire after serving for three or more decades. Then they face the biggest challenge of their life because their pensions are not paid to them in the very next month after they retire. They become jobless and have no income at all.\nAbout three or four decades ago it took more than three or four years to pay the pension for the public servants who retired and sometimes they did not live to receive their first pension. But this situation gradually changed and this `dark waiting periodâ€™ without any income was reduced to three or two years and then one or two years. At the moment usually it takes a few months. Even now some public servants need to wait for several months to get their first pension and sometimes they get it within a few months. Some public servants who handle this service delay some pensions purposely due to jealousy etc.\nMany Sri Lankans are cunning and it is their nature. Once the mother/father or both parents pass away, the children continue to obtain their pensions. This happens due to the lack of general knowledge and ignorance of public servants who handle various parts of the pension. First, it is the Department of Pensions. Then comes the Divisional Secretariat of the specific area where the pensioner has lived. The Grama Niladhari of the specific Grama Niladhari Division where the pensioner lived is also responsible and it is his/her duty to certify whether the relevant pensioner is still alive or dead.\nOtherwise, the children of the dead pensioners will continue to obtain pensions without any problem and it happens when the pension directly goes to the bank account of the pensioner. The children can very easily withdraw the pension from the ATM of the relevant bank even without the knowledge of a living and permanently disabled or mentally sick pensioner. This is the ground reality of Sri Lanka. It is a little bit difficult when the pensioners go to the Post Office, sign and obtain the pension. Even then the children can get the dead parentsâ€™ pensions without any trouble because they are extremely familiar with the Sub Post Office of their village and usually they get the signature of their parents, go to the post office and get the pension because the staffers of the sub-post office are familiar with the villagers.\nWhat is required is a proper monitoring system and tracking system. This can be very easily established through Grama Niladharis. At the moment they only check whether the relevant pensioner is living or dead only when they need to certify the free railway Warrants issued to all pensioners annually. Not all pensioners use those free warrants because most of the pensioners are old, sick and unable to travel by train. Only a few pensioners use one or two sets of warrants.\nAt the moment the children are eligible to receive their parentsâ€™ pensions only if they are permanently disabled, mentally retarded etc and it should be certified by a Medical Board. Otherwise male children receive the pension until they turn 18 and female children receive the pension until they turn 21 or get married. The pension ceases if female children get married before the age of 21. If not they receive it until they turn 21. It is the same with Widowâ€™s & Orphanâ€™s Pension (W&OP). These are the current rules and regulations of paying a pension to Sri Lankan citizens.\nUsually Sri Lankan public servants retire at the age of 60 and by that time they have children around the age of 30. Therefore usually children above the age of 30 do not need pensions from their parents because they can easily work and earn a living. Only the children who are permanently disabled, mentally retarded etc need parentsâ€™ assistance to live. Therefore it is the sole responsibility of all relevant officials, State Departments, and Public Servants to implement the existing law strictly in order to stop illegal pensions and prevent such pension payments in the future.\nThe Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) is a Parliamentary Committee established on July 21, 1979, by the Parliament of Sri Lanka. Whatever information revealed by this committee should be treated seriously because it is all about public money collected through taxes.\nÂ \nThe post Resolve pension anomalies appeared first on DailyNews.','Editorial','2024-06-30','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/01/editorial/579075/resolve-pension-anomalies/',NULL),(8,_binary 'fŒUñ*T‚Å˜µ','A long overdue step','<p>President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday asserted that he would be forced to declare teaching an Essential Service (ES) if teachers continue to&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/06/29/editorial/578425/a-long-overdue-step-3/\">A long overdue step</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk\">DailyNews</a>.</p>','President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday asserted that he would be forced to declare teaching an Essential Service (ES) if teachers continue to engage in their agitations. In an audience with the Most Ven. Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates in Kandy on Thursday, the President emphasized the need for teachers to be present in the schools during school hours for the education of the nationâ€™s children.\nHe noted that since 2022 teachers received a salary increase ranging from Rs.13,000 to Rs 27,000 adding that other Government servants too had to be considered. He also noted that strike actions of the teachers were confined to only Sinhala medium schools while commending the Tamil, Muslim and private schools for ensuring an uninterrupted education for children.\nThe Presidentâ€™s move to declare the teaching profession as an ES, was long overdue, given the frequency with which teachers took to the streets giving no consideration for the future of their charges. Soon after the Presidentâ€™s declaration, Teacher Trade Union front-man Joseph Stalin rejected the idea saying they would not abide by the ruling and would continue their agitations if the teacher salary demand went unanswered.\nPerhaps, the main reason for the arrogance of the trade unionists in this instance, no doubt, stemmed from the failure of the authorities to give effect to the ES regulations in real terms. Thus far, the Emergency Regulations decree had been applied to many service sectors such as the railways, postal services, ports etc. during strikes. However, no sooner things returned to normal, the miscreants always went scot free, the ES decree notwithstanding.\nThis is mainly due to the political backing enjoyed by these trade unions and the knowledge that they are certain to be bailed out through political intervention. Hence, ES regulations had so far lacked teeth, which is the reason for the strikers to ignore them so far.\nThis situation must change. The decree that those who continued to engaged in strike action when ES had been declared, is deemed to have vacated post should be implemented to the letter. There can be no compromise in this respect. The spate of strikes that now has become all too common must be brought to an end. The economy which is just beginning to show a revival cannot afford the luxury of serial strike action.\nThat the ES regulation is to be brought to bear on the teaching profession is indeed a telling indictment on the present day teachers who have not only sullied their own reputations but also that of their noble profession. The Presidentâ€™s decision in this regard, one would agree, is well justified considering the implications the spate of teacher strikes are going to have on the future generation. Are we going to experience a scenario similar to that which has hit our universities which are closed more often than not? Are the children attending private and International schools going to steal an advantage over that of their counterparts in State run schools which operate only in fits and starts due to the on-going teacher strikes?\nHarsh measures are called for to deal with the errant teachers whose priority which ought to be the education of students has now been replaced with greed and selfishness. They no longer deserve the honour and regard accorded to the teaching profession in the past. In that bygone era teachers and Principals were held in such high esteem that ordinary folk sought their counsel even on personal matters. The Loku Iskoley Mahattaya (School Principal) in the village was a much sought after figure for advice and guidance.\nWhat a contrast with the present where the teaching community as a whole have lost all regard and honour and descended to this sorry pass. The Government should not give in to the unreasonable demands of the teachersâ€™ unions. As the President noted, this could open the floodgates at a time all efforts are being made to stabilize the economy. Under the circumstances, the only way granting salary increases across the board could be made possible is by printing money on which the IMF has imposed a strict taboo. Even with the printing of money, salary increases to teachers would be a meaningless exercise with the devaluation of money due to inflation. The teachers more than other segments ought to understand this reality instead of insisting on their pound of flesh at whatever cost.\nThe teachers and principals should be shown where to get off. Their lot has been having things their own way for far too long. Teachers who boycott school should be sacked under ES laws and replacements found to fill in the breach. Students cannot be allowed to be held to ransom in this manner. Besides, the violent conduct of the teachers, including female teachers, who were seen engaging in fierce battles with the Police, does not bode well for the profession.

Some 80 plus Government teachersâ€™ trade unions yesterday pulled out their members for the second day running over the alleged failure by the Government to meet their salary demands.Â  This has now become a very familiar scenario and should be viewed with the seriousness it deserves by the authorities.\nAfter all, what is at stake is the future of the countryâ€™s student population. Yesterdayâ€™s strike action by the teachers coincided withÂ  the beginning of evaluation of the GCE O/L answer scripts. But for the teachers this was furthest from their minds. All that they were interested in was extracting their pound of flesh.\nTeachers going on strike for whatever reason is a relatively new phenomenon. In the past, teachers devoted their time and energy towards their primary duty of preparing their charges for the future by imparting knowledge but also for making them responsible citizens who will go on to serve the Motherland with honour and distinction. They had no time for any other pursuits and were quite satisfied by what they received in terms of emoluments.\nAlas, the present lot is indeed an insult to their counterparts of that different era and have only brought shame and insult to their noble profession. Yesterday, students were shown on TV arriving at their schools only to be turned away at the entrance by security staff. The students told the interviewers that they were not informed of a teachersâ€™ strike beforehand, and hence came to school as usual. This while the teachers were engaged in fierce battles with the Police on the streets and being subject to water cannon and teargas blasts. Some of the teachers even turned violent with some among them shown on TV hurling stones and other missiles at the Police. This is in sharp contrast to the primary task of teachers â€“ teaching and veering students away from all forms of violence.\nThe reason for the teachers to go on strike for a second day according to Trade Union frontman Joseph Stalin was due to the Police tear-gassing teachers on earlier occasions. In other words the teachers have seen it fit to take it out on the students for what, after all, was Police action to uphold the rule of law.Â  How can any reasonable mind not comprehend this? One must also take note that the teachers staged their strike action in defiance of Court orders preventing them from entering certain areas in order to facilitate traffic movement. This is tantamount to teachers going on to snub the law which is contrary to what, one imagines, is taught in the classrooms viz. obedienceÂ  to the law.\nIn a bygone era, teachers and principals were held in such high esteem that they were invariably invited by the villagers to get through the first phases of a childâ€™s life by helping the child with the alphabet. The Loku Iskoley Mahattaya (School Principal) in the village was a much sought after figure for advice and guidance and considered as an oracle.\nWhat a contrast with the present where the teaching community, as a whole, have lowered themselves to the level of just another trade union holding demonstrations and staging protests near the Fort Railway station and the Lipton Circus. The Government should not give itself into the demands and declare the teaching profession an Essential Service. Teachers who boycott school should be sacked and replacements found to fill in the breach. Students cannot be allowed to be held to ransom in this manner.\nTeachers and Principals should be shown where to get off. They have been having things their own way for too long. Present day teachers and Principals are only interested in amassing wealth. The Media reported recently how a school Principal in a remote village was arrested by the Police for engaging in the moonshine (kasippu) business at his home. Instances were also reported where teachers engaged in private tuition had sexually abused their charges. Such conduct by the teachers was unheard of in the past. Today the teachers have brought disgrace to this once noble profession by their unbecoming conduct. It is now left to the few teachers who are above board to try and restore the prestige of their profession which has been dealt a body blow by the behaviour and conduct of their fellow colleagues.\nThe Government for its part should bring in laws to ban all teachers trade unions which are nothing but appendages of extremist political groups. The participation of such party representatives in the teachersâ€™ strikes in the past bears this out.Â  Teachers should demonstrate by example that they deserve all demands they make by first devoting their time and energies for the development and advancement of the student population.\nWe say this because, as already mentioned, teachers hold a special place in society not only for their education and erudition but also their role as guiding lights to the younger generation. In their hands lie the future of the young and they should strive to reflect this through exemplary conduct.\nÂ \nThe post Huge slur on a noble profession appeared first on DailyNews.','Editorial','2024-06-27','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/06/28/editorial/577951/huge-slur-on-a-noble-profession/',NULL);

Born on the east side of Oahu, Perry had been surfing professionally for over a decade.\nIn a blurb on the Oahu Surfing Experience, where he was an instructor, he described his experiences surfing â€œthe worldâ€™s deadliest waveâ€.\nâ€œThis small time island boy can bang it out with the worldâ€™s best,â€ he wrote.\nHe also said that several years ago, he was involved in â€œa freak accident that turned into a near-fatal experienceâ€.\nPerry didnâ€™t elaborate on what the incident had involved, but said it happened because of someone elseâ€™s â€œlack of awarenessâ€.\nActing Honolulu Ocean Safety chief Kurt Lager said Perry was â€œa lifeguard loved by allâ€, adding that he was well known on Oahuâ€™s north shore as well as around the world.\nâ€œTamayoâ€™s personality was infectious, and as much as people loved him, he loved everyone else more.â€\nHe added: â€œOur condolences go out to Tamayoâ€™s family.â€\nMayor Rick Blangiardi echoed Lagerâ€™s sentiments, calling Perryâ€™s death â€œa tragic lossâ€.\nAddressing the press conference, he said: â€œTamayo was a legendary waterman and highly respected, [he] grew up right over here, and just a great member of our ocean safety team.â€\nHe said getting a call like that on a Sunday afternoon was â€œhard to imagineâ€, and called on Perryâ€™s family to be given privacy to grieve.

The magnitude of this achievement is underscored by the rarity of such accolades in the highly competitive music industry.\nCeline Dion, who has battled a rare neurological disorder, made a surprise appearance to present Swift with the coveted award. Dionâ€™s triumphant return to the stage was met with a warm reception from the audience, underscoring the resilience and enduring spirit of music icons.\nSwift, known for her ability to surprise and captivate, did not disappoint her fans at the ceremony. In a move that sent shockwaves through the music community, she announced the release of a new album during the event. The news left fans eagerly anticipating another chapter in Swiftâ€™s illustrious career.\nWhile Swiftâ€™s achievements took centre stage, other notable artistes also claimed their share of the spotlight. Miley Cyrus, with her soulful anthem Flowers, secured Record of the Year, showcasing her versatility as an artiste. Billie Eilish, no stranger to Grammy success, was honored with Song of the Year for What Was I Made For?.\nThe Grammy Awards saw a strong representation of women, with R&B luminaries SZA and Victoria MonÃ©t, along with the all-female indie supergroup Boygenius, receiving multiple awards. Tracy Chapman and Joni Mitchell delivered rare and poignant performances, reminding the audience of the enduring power of iconic voices in the industry.\nHowever, the night was not without its share of controversy. Killer Mike, the top male winner of the evening with three rap trophies, found himself in the midst of an apparent backstage altercation, resulting in him being â€œbooked for misdemeanor battery,â€ according to LA police.\nSwift, in her acceptance speech, emphasized her deep love for the creative process, stating, â€œFor me, the award is the work.â€ She shared her equal appreciation for simple moments in her musical journey, emphasizing the joy derived from finishing a song, rehearsing, or preparing for a show. Swiftâ€™s humility and passion for music resonated with fans and fellow artistes alike.\nExpressing gratitude for the award, Swift acknowledged the happiness it brings not only to herself but also to those who voted for her. Her previous victories in the Album of the Year category for Fearless (2010), 1989 (2016), and Folklore (2021) paved the way for her historic win with Midnights.\nDespite her triumphs, Swift has yet to secure awards for Song or Record of the Year, highlighting the depth of competition in these categories. Billie Eilishâ€™s win for What Was I Made For? in the Song of the Year category, beating Swiftâ€™s Anti-Hero, underscored the fierce competition among the industryâ€™s best songwriters.\nJoni Mitchell performs Both Sides Now\nCeline Dionâ€™s appearance will dispel some fears about the state of her health\nJay-Z with his daughter Blue Ivy Carter, accepting the Dr. Dre global impact award.\nMariah Carey presented Miley Cyrus with her first ever Grammy Award\nDua Lipa was up for song of the year for her Barbie song, Dance the Night\nThe post Grammy Awards 2024 appeared first on DailyNews.','Entertainment','2024-02-05','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/02/06/entertainment/383615/grammy-awards-2024/','https://www.dailynews.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/07-Grammy-02.jpg'),(9,_binary 'fŒV»*T‚Å˜\Â','Where Brushstrokes Breathe and  Stories Sing','<p>Imbued with diversity and a myriad of artistic expressions, KALÄ€, in association with the Lionel Wendt Art Centre, unveiled its maiden art&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/02/06/entertainment/383598/where-brushstrokes-breathe-and-stories-sing/\">Where Brushstrokes Breathe and  Stories Sing</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk\">DailyNews</a>.</p>','Imbued with diversity and a myriad of artistic expressions, KALÄ€, in association with the Lionel Wendt Art Centre, unveiled its maiden art exhibition â€˜Pivot Glide Echoâ€™ on January 28 with the presence of the curator and viewers from every nook and corner of the city. This worth-watching exhibition will continue until February 25 at Lionel Wendt and invites you to connect with the beauty of the artistic soul while embarking on a journey through boundless realms of creativity.\nProfound beauty of KALÄ€ is regarded as South Asiaâ€™s maiden educational and artistic platform. Curated by KALÄ€ assistant Mariyam Begum under the guidance of KALÄ€ Curatorial Advisor Sandhini Poddar, Adjunct Curator at Large of the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, â€˜Pivot Glide Echoâ€™ undoubtedly serves as a source of inspiration for artists. Needless to mention that KALÄ€ is a golden opportunity for both artists and art lovers in our country.\nWhen I stepped into the KALÄ€ exhibition, I found myself being carried away by a plethora of artistic expressions. The arrangement of each piece of artwork spontaneously guides the viewers on a seamless trajectory towards a symphony of creativity. Synergy between light and shadow enhances the visual impact of creations, captivating the viewersâ€™ eyes. Indeed, breathing stories depicted in artworks have the power to transport the viewers to various eras from the colonial period to the modern era. Artistsâ€™ brushstrokes, uncovering their own interpretations of reality through their creations, serve as a testament to their endless sensitivity, commitment, and masterful brilliance.\nThe soundtrack of the heart-soothing music woven into the atmosphere blended with serenity contributes to sensory enrichment.\nWhat holds true is the fact that KALÄ€ bridges the chasm between artworks and the audience, weaving a tapestry of creativity, emotions, artistic expressions, and shared experiences. To be honest, the distance and boundaries between creations and visitors blur into obscurity. As an art lover, I myself felt that most visitors had become a part of the exhibition naturally. Some visitors were deeply moved, while others were pausing before certain artworks. Their eyes glued to the breathing canvases disclosed their curiosity, passion, and love for artworks.

Speaking at a ceremony held at the North Western Provincial Council auditorium in Kurunegala yesterday to present deeds to 463 recipients under Urumaya national programme, the President said that the country has four year plan to repay the loans, offering reduced burdens and interest cuts that will yield US$ 5 billion in savings.\nâ€œNow, our country has emerged from bankruptcy. We are currently in negotiations with private creditors. As a result, US$ 3 billion has been withdrawn. In total, US$ 8 billion has been allocated for our use, the President said. The President said that the country has been granted US$ 2 billion under relaxed terms and this does not account for funds expected from China or assistance from India. â€œAdditionally, we have been granted US$ 2 billion under relaxed terms This does not account for funds expected from China or assistance from India. As a result, we have saved USD 8 billion over the past two years.â€\nâ€œBefore assuming office, during President Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s tenure, India provided US$ 3.5 billion on favourable loan terms.Bangladesh also contributed US$ 200 million.Despite economic challenges, we managed to repay US$ 200 millionâ€, he added.\nThe President emphasized that true socialism lies in granting free land rights to the people, dismissing mere talk about socialism.\nHe highlighted that his government, credited with rescuing the country from bankruptcy, is actively addressing public issues.He pointed out that an additional 200,000 individuals will benefit from the â€œUrumayaâ€ freehold land title initiative.\nAddressing the gathering, he noted that he assumed leadership during a period of governmental uncertainty. He emphasized that the nation is now recovering from economic turmoil due to effective economic management. He highlighted plans for inclusive development in Kurunegala district as part of advancing the countryâ€™s new economy.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe further elaborated; In the Kurunegala district, our farmers, who are vital to our rice supply, have lacked rightful ownership of their lands for too long. Today, hundreds of thousands of people across our country face the challenge of living without legal rights to their homes. We launched the â€œUrumayaâ€ programme to ensure they receive the rights they deserve.\nWhen I took office, it was a time of great uncertainty.Leaders were scarce, but I stepped up to lead. We formed a government by uniting different parties, and together, weâ€™ve made significant strides in addressing the peopleâ€™s concerns.\nWhen our countryâ€™s economy collapsed, many lost hope. Today, I must express my gratitude to the residents of this area. Despite facing personal challenges akin to a house on fire, they prioritized community welfare and worked tirelessly to provide relief. Now, our country has emerged from bankruptcy. We have a four-year plan to repay our loans, offering reduced burdens and interest cuts that will yield USD 5 billion in savings.\nWe are currently in negotiations with private contractors. As a result, approximately USD 3 billion has been withdrawn. In total, USD 8 billion has been allocated for our use. Additionally, we have been granted USD 2 billion under relaxed terms. This does not account for funds expected from China or assistance from India. As a result, we have saved USD 8 billion over the past two years.\nBefore assuming office, during President Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s tenure, India provided USD 3.5 billion on favourable loan terms. Bangladesh also contributed USD 200 million. Despite economic challenges, we managed to repay USD 200 million.\nIâ€™ve had to make tough decisions to rebuild our economy. Raising VAT wasnâ€™t easy, but it was necessary to stabilize our economy. Some leaders urged people to protest and even burn houses, urging them not to support the government. Farmers were told to come to Colombo, but without fuel and fertilizers, they couldnâ€™t come. We provided essential fuel and fertilizers to support them. Eventually, they were asked to come to Colombo without planting crops.\nThanks to the harvest in 2022-2023, the countryâ€™s production increased, and tourism thrived. As a result, weâ€™ve achieved an USD 8 billion relief and paved the way to debt relief. When the economy collapses, it affects ordinary people the most. When it recovers, its benefits reach another segment. We launched the â€œUrumayaâ€ freehold land deeds program to benefit ordinary people. Today, these individuals have full ownership rights to the land theyâ€™ve lived on for generations. This is indeed a governmentâ€™s record.\nThe post US$ 8 Bn relief achieved through debt restructuring â€“ President appeared first on DailyNews.','Politics','2024-07-05','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/06/admin-catagories/breaking-news/582863/us-8-bn-relief-achieved-through-debt-restructuring-president/','https://www.dailynews.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1-9.jpg'),(8,_binary 'fŒUD*T‚Å˜ª','IMF programme has yielded positive results for country â€“ State Minister','<p>Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe stated that the programme implemented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the government, in collaboration with the International&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/06/admin-catagories/breaking-news/582894/imf-programme-has-yielded-positive-results-for-country-state-minister/\">IMF programme has yielded positive results for country &#8211; State Minister</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk\">DailyNews</a>.</p>','Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe stated that the programme implemented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the government, in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other foreign partners, has yielded positive results for the country, creating a stable economic environment and a livable setting for the people.

The first three matches we couldnâ€™t win but our batters did well and bowlers had few issues and restricting opponents below 200 runs on this type of wicket always a plus point to win the game. We restricted Colombo team for 185 at Dambulla wicket and that was a good achievement on this type of surface. After I got a century in previous game against Jaffna Kings at Pallekele once again made match winning 80 in the last game against Colombo Strikers at Dambulla. Both myself and my opening partner Reza Hendrikas intention was always attack the ball during the power play and then continue innings and easy to find the gaps to make runs and that really worked out said Kusal He is having fastest LPL century record this time while his aggressive mood during power play is big challenge for opponent bowlers.\nGalle Marvels all rounder Isuru Udana in action\nIn fact Kusal Perera was not sold at the LPL auction earlier finally got chance to enter Dambulla Sixes. He is now in top form and this wicket keeper and left hand batter is playing an important role for Dambulla Sixes. They have three more matches and already in fourth place with 2 points after losing three matches and they wanted to repeat performance to get wins to go forward.\nOur skipper Mohammed Nabi is a veteran in this white ball format and give good freedom to all players while our supporting staff headed by Rangana Herath and mentor Roshan Mahanama give good support to the team.\nEspecially on this type of wicket batsmen can get runs to build up innings and bowlersâ€™ performance are very vital to restrict opponents, said Perera.\nI think foreign players service and mixed with our local players always very vital from this LPL and most important is to maintain good momentum during the matches. Getting first win at Dambulla Stadium was very good . The foreign players Reza Hendrikas, Mark Chapman are in good form while the paceman like Mustafizur Rahman always strength to Dambulla and young Chamindu Wickrmasinghe also an asset to them.\nMeanwhile Galle Marvels led by Niroshan Dikwella having 3 wins out of 4 matches having services of two foreign players Tim Seifert and Alex Hales who always power their batting department. All rounder Isuru Udana who was last Kandy Falcons game man of the match used his experience especially during the power play. Udana already retired from International cricket plays active role in franchise cricket this time as a Galle Marvels key player. I think year by year LPL get good developments and we hope few players can be found from this franchise tournaments said Udana mixing with foreign players is extra benefit for young players to share their experience. Our coach Graham Ford had good knowledge about these wickets as well as our players as he was the former Sri Lanka coach. We wanted to maintain winning momentum to go forward said Isuru Udana.\nMeanwhile Kandy Falcons will meet table leaders Jaffna Kings in their game at 2.30 pm. Jaffna led by Charith Asalanka having best net run rate (0.516) with 6 points on top. Batting is key strength of Jaffna having services of Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis,Avishka Fernando and skipper Asalanka while Azmatullah Omarzai the all rounder from Afghanistan is in good form. Kandy Falcons led by Wanindu Hasaranga couldnâ€™t make good performance while they are looking to come back in this game. Experienced Angelo Mathews, Dasun Shanaka and skipper Wanindu Hasaranga have big responsibility to put up a good challenge while Dinesh Chandimal also has to come from as a opener.\nGalle Marvels also having 6 points with 0.369 run rate on second after four matches while Colombo Strikers having 4 points in third place and both Dambulla Sixes and Kandy Falcons having only 2 points each with a solitary win are fourth and fifth while Dambulla who got 8 wickets win over Colombo Strikers having better run rate ahead of Kandy Falcons.\nThe post Dambulla Sixes out to put up a good fight against Galle Marvels appeared first on DailyNews.','Sport','2024-07-08','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/09/sports/584225/dambulla-sixes-out-to-put-up-a-good-fight-against-galle-marvels/','https://www.dailynews.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/16-Dambulla-02.jpg'),(1,_binary 'fŒT\0*T‚Å˜','Josephian Jayasinghe to lead Sri Lanka','<p>Methika Jayasinghe of St. Josephâ€™s College, Colombo, will captain Sri Lanka at the four-nation FIBA Under 18 Asia Cup 2024 &#8211; SABA&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/09/sports/584242/josephian-jayasinghe-to-lead-sri-lanka/\">Josephian Jayasinghe to lead Sri Lanka</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk\">DailyNews</a>.</p>','Methika Jayasinghe of St. Josephâ€™s College, Colombo, will captain Sri Lanka at the four-nation FIBA Under 18 Asia Cup 2024 â€“ SABA Qualifiers.

He had lot of difficulties earlier when he came from Kalutara Vidyalaya to Isipathana College Colombo and later joined NCC which is the turning point of his career .He got the National cap in T- 20 against West Indies in 2021 and then got chance to play ODI â€˜ s and Tests.

Recently we got good wickets in Sri Lanka and our duty is to play with more confidence.I think young batsmen and bowlers get maximum opportunity by playing on this type of wickets said Nissanka.\nThe supporting staff of Jaffna Kings headed by coach Avishka Gunawardena, conditioning and fast bowling coach Mario Villawarayan ,spin coach Sachith Pathirana as well as Manager Charinda Fernando give maximum support to us .Especially head coach Avishka Gunawardena gives good guidance So far we are on top getting six points out of four matches and we hope to to go forward said Pathum Nissanka.\nThe post Dambulla wicket is ideal for batsmen, says Pathum Nissanka appeared first on DailyNews.','Sport','2024-07-08','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/09/sports/583765/dambulla-wicket-is-ideal-for-batsmen-says-pathum-nissanka/',NULL),(9,_binary 'fŒT*T‚Å˜•','Air Force Sports Stars honoured at colours award ceremony','<p>The athletes and sport officials who excelled for Air Force received awards at the Air Force colours award ceremony (2022-23) which was&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/09/sports/583900/air-force-sports-stars-honoured-at-colours-award-ceremony/\">Air Force Sports Stars honoured at colours award ceremony</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.lk\">DailyNews</a>.</p>','Most dedicated sports Personality of the year 2023 Flight Sargent C.C Jayawickrama ( Manager Weightlifting ) receiving award from Defence Secretary General Kamal Gunaratne\nThe athletes and sport officials who excelled for Air Force received awards at the Air Force colours award ceremony (2022-23) which was held at the Eagles Lakeside Banquet and Convention Hall on Friday.\nThe Group Captain Roger Weerasinghe Memorial Trophy for Most Outstanding Upcoming Sports Personality was awarded to Corporal LRD Perera for Netball in the year 2022 and Lady Officer Cadet J.M.S Savindi for Swimming in 2023.\nLeading Aircraftwoman MPSS Coorey for Boxing in 2022 and Sergeant O.U Ranasinghe for Cricket in 2023 bagged the Flight Lieutenant Priya Abeyweeragunawardana Memorial Trophy for the most Outstanding Sportswoman.\nFlight Lieutenant A Vartharasa Memorial Trophy for the Most Outstanding Sportsman was awarded to Sergeant R.N.C Dharmawardana for Judo in 2022 and Leading Aircraftman S.M.M Jayathilake for Weightlifting in 2023.

Thus in total, USD 8 billion has been allocated for our use. Additionally, we have been granted USD 2 billion under relaxed terms. This does not account for funds expected from China or assistance from India. As a result, we have saved USD 8 billion over the past two years,â€ the President said.\nâ€œDuring President Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s tenure, India provided USD 3.5 billion on favourable loan terms. Bangladesh also contributed USD 200 million. Despite economic challenges, we managed to repay USD 200 million. These achievements were made possible as a result of the tough economic decisions I had to make amid a lot of discontent. Raising VAT wasnâ€™t easy, but it was necessary to stabilize the economy.\nThanks to the harvest in 2022-2023, the countryâ€™s production increased, and tourism thrived. With these achievements and the fiscal discipline in line with the IMF programme, we have been able to achieve debt relief accounting for USD 8 billion. . When the economy collapses, it affects ordinary people the most. When it recovers, its benefits reach another segment. We launched the â€œUrumayaâ€ freehold land deeds program to benefit the ordinary people. Today, these individuals have full ownership rights to the land theyâ€™ve lived on for generations. This is indeed a record set by the government which is akin to a socialist policy driven project,â€ he said.','business','2024-07-07','http://island.lk/in-bad-times-ordinary-people-suffer-in-good-times-benefits-reach-another-segment-president/',NULL),(1,_binary 'fŒKF*T‚Å˜','Nawaloka Hospitals felicitates Sri Lankaâ€™s Nephrology trailblazers','For completing 500 successful kidney transplant surgeries As the pioneer of Tertiary Health Care in Sri Lanka, Nawaloka Hospitals PLC is honored to felicitate the pioneers in the field of Nephrology in Sri Lanka and announce the successful completion of 500 kidney transplant surgeries to date.

Addressing a group of community police members in Wellawaya, on Saturday, he expressed serious concern about the practice of human rights activists and lawyers rising in defence of drug lords taken into custody. Opinion may be divided on this score, but the Presidentâ€™s concern undoubtedly resonates with the public, given the increasing severity of the drug menace, which has engulfed even schools; the victims of the drug Mafia are without anyone to fight for their human rights!\nPresident Wickremesinghe also highlighted the inadequacies of the existing anti-drug laws, and stressed the need for new ones to fight the drug Mafia effectively. He pointed out that countries like Singapore had adopted extreme measures such as the death penalty to tackle the drug problem. One cannot but agree that there is a pressing need for strong laws in this country to protect the public against drug dealers. However, even such laws, unless enforced strictly, will serve little purpose.\nThe police embarked on a much-hyped campaign to neutralise the crime syndicates involved in drug trafficking, etc., amidst claims in some quarters that it caused human rights violations. But we believe that the anti-drug operations must go on, as they have yielded huge amounts of narcotics and helped weaken the distribution network to a considerable extent. Care must be taken to leave no room for excesses.\nHowever, the drug problem is best tackled at source. The ongoing efforts to thwart drug smuggling via sea routes have to be redoubled; a watchful eye must be kept on the countryâ€™s ports, where huge consignments of drugs have been detected. A large number of fishing craft used for drug trafficking have been taken into custody with their crew members. Increasing naval patrol to hold drug smugglers at bay, we believe, will be half the battle in breaking the back of the narcotic problem. The Navy and the Coastguard must be provided with more vessels, personnel and technology to intensify their effective anti-drug operations.\nDrug barons use a fraction of their ill-gotten wealth to retain the best lawyers in the country, bribe corrupt politicians and rogues in uniform and thereby put paid to efforts to make them pay for their crimes. The integrity of the drug testing process is also in doubt, and allegations abound that narcotic samples are tampered with.\nA notorious drug dealer, known as Kanjipani Imran, fled the country after being enlarged on bail. Many criminals like him are running their drug cartels here from overseas, and the need for new laws to prevent them being bailed out cannot be overstated. Imran is believed to have used various fronts to launder his drug money here and abroad. These dangerous characters, operating from faraway countries, are capable of having anyone physically eliminated here, as evident from the numerous killings committed at their behest. They have emerged so powerful that, a few months ago, they planned a commando-type operation with inside help to remove two drug kingpins from the CID headquarters, where they were being detained at the time. Thankfully, their plan went awry. This shows that while the issue of inadequacies and paucity of anti-drug laws are addressed urgently, much more remains to be done to eliminate the narcotic trade, which serves as a wellspring for numerous crimes and poses a threat to national security as well.\nMeanwhile, drug dealers are known to use their slush funds to bankroll election campaigns of some influential politicians. The rise of the narcotic Mafia is attributable to the nexus between drug kingpins and politicians. Hence the need to ensure transparency and accountability in respect of campaign funding while new anti-drug laws with more teeth are made and action is taken to weed out the rogues in uniform in the pay of the drug barons.','Editorial','2024-07-07','http://island.lk/drugs-criminals-and-human-rights/',NULL),(1,_binary 'fŒN\æ*T‚Å˜?','Whodunnit?','President Ranil Wickremesinghe was quick to dissociate himself from the Fundamental Rights action on the forthcoming election filed in the Supreme Court last week by an unknown private citizen whose name, Chamindra Dayan Lenawa, was published in all the newspapers and electronic media bulletins that ran the story. No doubt the president was well aware [&#8230;]','President Ranil Wickremesinghe was quick to dissociate himself from the Fundamental Rights action on the forthcoming election filed in the Supreme Court last week by an unknown private citizen whose name, Chamindra Dayan Lenawa, was published in all the newspapers and electronic media bulletins that ran the story. No doubt the president was well aware of a suspicion in the public mind that he was behind the court action which sought a SC order that no election be held until the correct constitutional position regrading such an election was determined by the court.\nHence the alacrity with which the Presidential Media Division (PMD) sought to rubbish the story. The first message said neither the president nor his lawyers had been consulted by the litigant. The second stressed that Wickremesinghe was firmly of the view that the presidential term was for five years. It is on that basis that the Elections Commission is preparing to hold the poll later this year.\nIt was reported on Friday that the chief justice had appointed a fuller five-judge bench chaired by himself to hear the case which will be taken up on Monday. Doubtlessly there will be public interest on the arguments urged in favour of not holding an election until the constitutional position is properly determined. These, of course, were set out in the petition itself. Peopleâ€™s Action for Free and Fair Election (PAFREL) has already said it will be an intervenient petitioner. Also the Attorney General has been cited as the seventh respondent in the matter and it is unlikely that his stance will be any different from the presidentâ€™s.\nThe chances are that an early determination will be made to clear whatever uncertainty there may be. Both Opposition/SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and NPP/JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, declared candidates for the forthcoming election, as well as other political activists have alleged that Wickremesinghe is behind the FR action. The president has not yet formally declared his own candidacy although his intimates are on public record that he will run.\nAlso posters are up and advertising time bought to proclaim â€œRanil is the man for now.â€ The wide perception is that heâ€™s a runner, but that is not a certainty. Relevantly, business tycoon Dhammika Perera who has expressed an interest in running as the SLPP candidate also appears to be keeping the ball in play by projecting his DP Education endeavour giving free distance education in Information Technology (IT) to young people. It has been claimed that the project has attracted over a million participants. Though the president and Perera not so long ago appeared to be adversaries, Wickremesinghe was recently chief guestat a DP Education function at Nelun Pokuna.\nAlthough the SLPP, the Rajapaksa party which elected Wickremesinghe president, have been waffling for the past several weeks, neither saying whether they are, nor they are not backing Wickremesingheâ€™s candidature, there was a further development last week. That was when when SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam went public with the assertion that Ranil â€œwill be considered for SLPP nominationâ€ if he quits the UNP and joins their party. The SLPP, of course, cannot be happy that many of their members are appearing on Wickremesinghe platforms. Our stablemate, The Island, last Thursday ran a lead story on its front page saying the â€œSLPP â€“ UNP alliance on the verge of collapse.â€ This alliance, as everybody knows, is what is ruling the country right now.\nThat report quoted UNP Chairman, Wajiira Abeywardene, MP, responding to a question on his partyâ€™s stance on Kariyawasamâ€™s statement saying that they would await a comment from from former president Mahinda Rajapaksa on this matter. He, after all, is leader of the SLPP. But it is generally perceived that Kariyawasam is the mouthpiece for Basil Rajapaksa, the founder/strategist of that party and onetime national organizer. Indications at present is that Wickremesinghe, unless he pulls out before nomination day, will run as an independent candidate with backing from various sections of the polity rather than under the UNP and its elephant symbol. Heâ€™s been recently courting such support with a degree of success. Several SLPPers, both cabinet ministers and backbenchers, have gone public that they are backing Wickremesinghe. They credit him for pulling the country out of the post Aragalaya doldrums an achieving a degree of normalcy and stress that his steady hand is required on the tiller for a further term.\nThe law provides for defectors elected on one party ticket joining another being expelled from their original party endangering their parliamentary seats. But parties have not resorted to this possibility in recent times. There is a due process, justiciable by the courts, that must precede expulsion. However, that sleeping dog has been allowed to lie by most political parties in recent times despite numerous defections.','Editorial','2024-07-06','http://island.lk/whodunnit/',NULL),(2,_binary 'fŒN\ç*T‚Å˜@','Darley Road puppet show','Saturday 6th July, 2024 Time was when the SLFP and the UNP dominated Sri Lankan politics, and captured power almost alternately so much so that we had a two-party system to all intents and purposes.

But today they have become shadows of their former selves and are struggling for survival. Worse, their offshoots have not only overtaken them but also rendered them almost irrelevant in national politics.\nThe UNP is lucky that the elevation of its leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, to the presidency, albeit fortuitously, has enabled it to recover some lost ground on the political front. But the SLFP continues to sink in a political mire of its own making apparently with no prospect of recovery anytime soon.\nIn what can be considered a dramatic turn of events, MP Dayasiri Jayasekera, who obtained an interim order from the Colombo District Court against the SLFPâ€™s decision to strip him of party membership and the post of General Secretary, assumed duties in front of the SLFP Headquarters at Darley Road, Colombo 10, yesterday. The police did not allow him to enter the party office.\nNo sooner had the interim order in question been issued than Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, whom the Chandrika faction of the SLFP appointed as the party Chairman, sacked Jayasekera. Now, there are two persons staking claims to the SLFP chairmanshipâ€”Minister de Silva and Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha. There are three persons who claim to be the SLFP General Secretaryâ€”Jayasekera, Dushmantha Mitrapala and Duminda Dissanayake. The partyâ€™s rank and file are confused and frustrated; many of them have already voted with their feet. Most of the SLFP MPs, elected on the SLPP ticket, have switched their allegiance to President Wickremesinghe.\nFormer President Maithripala Sirisena, who resigned as the SLFP Chairman, is pulling the strings. Ex-President Kumaratunga is doing likewise. Their proxies are at war. The unfolding Darley Road drama is like an Ambalangoda rookada (puppet) show.\nThe police are all out to ensure that the rivals of the Chandrika faction do not gain access to the SLFP party office. It is obvious that they are doing so at the behest of the powers that be. The anti-Sirisena faction of the SLFP supports President Wickremesinghe. Sirisena and his loyalists were planning to field Minister Rajapaksha as the SLFPâ€™s presidential candidate. Their attempt has been in vain; their rivals have gained the upper hand with the help of the police, and others.\nThe SLFP is no stranger to internecine legal battles among its ambitious leaders. Even some members of the Bandaranaike family failed to be different, and as a result the SLFP remained in the political wilderness for 17 years, after its humiliating defeat at the 1977 general election.\nThe SLFP has had two of its General Secretaries decampingâ€”S. B. Dissanayake in 2001 and Sirisena in late 2014. In 2005, the then President Kumaratunga sought to queer the pitch for the SLFPâ€™s presidential candidate, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had ruffled her feathers. She failed in her endeavour. Ten years later, President Sirisena ruined the SLFP-led UPFAâ€™s chances of winning a general election, as he had an axe to grind with Mahinda, who was the partyâ€™s prime ministerial candidate at the time. The SLFP has not recovered from the crippling split it suffered due to clashes between the then Sirisena-Kumaratunga faction, which sided with the UNP, and the Rajapaksa loyalists.\nThe SLFP is in the current predicament because its leaders never hesitate to subjugate its interests to their personal agendas. Whichever faction emerges victorious in the intraparty war at Darley Road, the SLFP will lose, for at this rate it is likely to end up being a mere nameboard, having lost significance, influence and following.','Editorial','2024-07-05','http://island.lk/darley-road-puppet-show/',NULL),(3,_binary 'fŒN\ç*T‚Å˜A','Keep genie in bottle','Friday 5th July, 2024 A person described as an entrepreneur from Moratuwa has filed a fundamental rights (FR) petition, seeking a Supreme Court (SC) determination on the duration of the presidentâ€™s term, and an interim order preventing the official announcement of the next presidential election until the apex court decision. The members of the Election [&#8230;]','Friday 5th July, 2024\nA person described as an entrepreneur from Moratuwa has filed a fundamental rights (FR) petition, seeking a Supreme Court (SC) determination on the duration of the presidentâ€™s term, and an interim order preventing the official announcement of the next presidential election until the apex court decision. The members of the Election Commission (EC) including its Chairman and the Attorney General have been named as respondents. This petition has not come as a surprise. We are reminded of a vain attempt President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga made in 2005 to remain in office until 2006.\nWe thought the Constitution was very clear on the duration of the presidential term. Otherwise, the EC would not have undertaken to hold the presidential election this year itself. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected, in 2019, for a period of five years, and following his resignation in 2022, Parliament elected Ranil Wickremesinghe as his successor to serve the remainder of his term. We, however, do not intend to dwell on the legal aspects of a matter that is before the SC. They are best left to the learned judges. Instead, we discuss the political, social and economic issues that arise from poll postponements.\nThe Opposition is letting out howls of protest against surreptitious moves being made to postpone the upcoming presidential election. It has vowed to do everything in its power to defeat them on both political and legal fronts. The SJB, the JVP/NPP, and the SLPP dissidents have said they will come forward as intervenient petitioners in respect of the FR petition at issue. One cannot but appreciate their concerns about democracy and action to counter threats to the peopleâ€™s franchise. They can rest assured that every right-thinking person, who cherishes democracy, will be on their side. (In this country, politicians fight for the peopleâ€™s democratic rights only when they happen to be in the Opposition!)\nAttempts to have the next presidential poll put off could prove counterproductive, for they are bound to go pear-shaped, and will be seen as proof that those who are behind them are afraid of facing elections.\nThe Presidential Media Division has issued a statement that President Wickremesinghe is of the view that the EC is right in having decided to hold the next presidential election this year. It has also said the person who filed the aforesaid petition had not consulted either President Wickremesinghe or his lawyers. But it is the UNP which has called for a poll postponement. Its General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara himself has reiterated that the presidential and parliamentary polls have to be put off.\nThe SLPP has claimed that it is against postponing elections. It seems to think that Sri Lankans are suffering from amnesia. It has postponed the Local Government polls twice. There is no bigger threat to democracy than a regime that undermines the peopleâ€™s franchise. Elections not only help the people elect their representatives to run political institutions or govern the country but also enable them to canalise their resentment towards those at the levers of power in a democratic manner.\nPressure that builds up in a polity, where the people undergo unbearable economic hardships and are denied their democratic rights including franchise, or elections do not reflect the popular will due to malpractices, etc., tends to find expression in political upheavals. There have been several instances where poll postponements made Sriâ€ˆLankan democracy scream. If the SLFP-led United Front government had not extended the life of Parliament by two years from 1975 to 1977, the UNP would not have been able to obtain a steamroller majority, which it abused in every conceivable manner to suppress democracy.\nThe scrapping of a general election due in 1982 with the help of a heavily-rigged referendum, under J. R. Jayewardeneâ€™s presidency, paved the way for the second JVP uprising and a bloodbath. Thousands of young lives were lost and state assets worth billions of rupees destroyed. The social and economic costs of the JVPâ€™s reign of terror and the UNPâ€™s equally savage counterterror operations were incalculable. The Gotabaya Rajapaksa government also blundered by putting off the LG polls. If they had been held on schedule, they would have allowed the public to give vent to their pent-up anger democratically, forcing that blundering regime to heed public opinion and make a course correction without provoking the people into taking to the streets. The postponement of the LG polls last year on President Ranil Wickremesingheâ€™s watch has also created a massive pressure build-up, which has the potential to erupt into an uprising. Another poll postponement will make the situation even more volatile.\nLet those who are making a last-ditch attempt to delay the presidential election be warned that they are playing with fire. They had better recall that the Rajapaksas, who preened themselves on having defeated terrorism, had to head for the hills in 2022 as they, in their wisdom, chose to slight public opinion and ride roughshod over the people. Unless those who boast of waging a successful economic war abandon their attempts to subvert democracy and stop testing the peopleâ€™s patience, which is manifestly wearing thin, it will soon be their turn to outrun the irate public.','Editorial','2024-07-04','http://island.lk/keep-genie-in-bottle/',NULL),(4,_binary 'fŒN\è*T‚Å˜B','EC in cockpit; Saturn in beggarâ€™s bowl','Thursday 4th July, 2024 The Election Commission (EC) has issued a media statement, reminding political parties and politicians that although the Local Government (LG) polls have been postponed, election laws governing them are in effect.

Therefore, the EC has warned that at present nobody must promote any specific candidate, political party, or independent group. It has also informed all heads of public institutions, through a circular and a gazette extraordinary, that no state property must be utilised for this purpose. The ECâ€™s actions and warning are timely; complaints abound that the politicians who have submitted nominations for the LG polls are involved in the presidential election campaigns of their political parties. The government stands accused of involving its LG polls candidates in state-funded development activities at the grassroots level so that they can gain political mileage while carrying out its presidential election campaign.\nSome political parties, such as the UNP, the SJB and the NPP, are busy promoting themselves as well as their prospective presidential candidates in view of the next presidential election, which has not yet been called officially. These political parties have submitted nominations for the deferred LG polls, and therefore it can be argued that they are violating the election laws. Arenâ€™t there sufficient grounds for legal action to be taken against them?\nInterestingly, the laws governing the LG and presidential polls will overlap soon when the EC declares the next presidential election. This unprecedented situation could raise a legal dilemma. Will the presidential election laws take precedence over those governing the LG polls, or will the LG election laws apply only to the LG candidates, excluding the political parties and independent groups they represent, in the run-up to the upcoming presidential election? The resulting confusion among the public could undermine the integrity of the election laws and the electoral process besides eroding public trust therein. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a clarification.\nAll election laws prohibit the misuse or abuse of public property for electioneering, but some questionable practices are prevalent, and, worse, they have been taken for granted. The President, the Prime Minister and ministers use government vehicles and even the SLAF aircraft for campaign related activities which are craftily made to look like official engagements. Needless to say, they do so at the expense of the public amidst a crippling economic crisis. These practices that amount to a blatant violation of election laws must be brought to an end; government politicians who misuse the state machinery, the publicly-owned aircraft and vehicles can carry out their election campaigns much more efficiently than their Opposition counterparts at lower costs, leaving the public to foot the bill. Extraordinary security arrangements for government bigwigsâ€™ travel throughout the country also cost the public an arm and a leg. If the existing laws do not provide for banning such practices, new ones must be brought in to ensure a level playing field for all candidates. Curiously, this issue has not been taken up in Parliament. Maybe the Opposition has chosen to remain silent because it is hoping to do likewise in the event of being voted into power.\nIt defies comprehension why the President, the Prime Minister, ministers and the Opposition Leader should be allowed to use their official vehicles, etc., for political work even during non-election times. They must be prevented from misusing state assets and public funds for their political work. They have a right to engage in politics but at their own expense, and the public, already crushed under multiple burdens including unconscionably high taxes, must not be made to pay through the nose to meet unnecessary expenses. The peopleâ€™s predicament, which in fact is a double whammy caused by spendthrift, inefficient politicians, is like Saturn, the evildoer, landing in a beggarâ€™s bowl, as a local saying goes.','Editorial','2024-07-04','http://island.lk/ec-in-cockpit-saturn-in-beggars-bowl/',NULL),(5,_binary 'fŒN\è*T‚Å˜C','Issues, non-issues and non sequiturs','Wednesday 3rd July, 2024 The SJB parliamentary group yesterday unanimously resolved that it would not join a national government under President Ranil Wickremesingheâ€™s leadership.

What prompted it to make such a resolution suddenly is not clear. Perhaps, it has only reiterated its response to an invitation President Wickremesinghe extended about two years ago.\nOne cannot but agree that there is absolutely no need for a national government, for such an arrangement does not benefit the public in a half-baked democracy like Sri Lanka, where politicians are driven by self-interest; they join forces to further their own interests and not for the sake of the country. The so-called national unity government formed by the UNP and the SLFP-led UPFA in 2015 is a case in point. That administration, which was a coming together of a bunch of strange bedfellows, was characterised by mega scams, other forms of corruption, the aggravation of the countryâ€™s indebtedness, inefficiency and the neglect of national security. It exemplified the popular saying that two dogs at the same bone seldom agree. Competing interests and personality clashes led to tensions among its leaders, and President Sirisena sought to dislodge it eventually, albeit in vain.\nWhat Sri Lanka needs is a national-minded government as well as a national-minded Opposition. The ruling coalition is all out to retain power, and the Opposition parties are doing their darndest to capture power, and the national interest does not figure in their agendas. The country is grappling with its worst-ever economic crisis, which has adversely impacted every facet of life, but the government and the Opposition are pulling in different directions oblivious to the need for a concerted effort. Sriâ€ˆLankan political leaders did not join forces even at the height of the Vanni war or in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe made a special statement in Parliament yesterday on the debt restructuring agreements. Much more information about those pacts remains to be disclosed. It is hoped that all agreements will be made available to the public after the restructuring of ISBs (International Sovereign Bonds). The Opposition claimed that Sri Lankaâ€™s creditors had not been made to take haircuts.\nThe so-called peopleâ€™s representatives in Sri Lanka are not prepared to forgo their duty-free vehicle permits and other such perks, much less share in the suffering of the public in any manner, but the Opposition politicians want the countryâ€™s creditors to take haircuts. They are of the same mindset as inveterate delinquent cardholders who inveigh against their banks after living beyond their means and finding themselves in dire financial straits. Loans have to be paid back. Let that be the bottom line.\nParliament should debate all vital agreements related to debt restructuring, but at the same time it ought to discuss ways and means of shoring up the countryâ€™s foreign exchange reserves, enhancing national productivity, boosting exports, combating corruption, curtailing waste and rationalising state expenditure. The government deserves the flak it is receiving, but the Opposition does not provide alternative solutions to the countryâ€™s burning issues; it only bellows rhetoric, mouths populist slogans, and advocates clientelism and welfarism. Instead of taking action to eliminate corruption in the Customs, Inland Revenue and the Exercise Department and cast the tax net wide, the government is bent on squeezing the public dry. The Opposition is promising tax cuts and freebies to the public in a bid to garner votes at the upcoming election. The SJB has undertaken to allocate more funds for education, healthcare, social welfare, etc., but it will not reveal how it is going to increase state revenue. The JVP/NPP has promised to grab power from the â€˜corrupt political elitesâ€™ and hand it over to the youth! It tried to do so on two occasionsâ€”in 1971 and in the late 1980sâ€”and left thousands of youth dead. Elites circulate, according to thinkers like Pareto, and one sees no difference between the traditional political elites and the JVP/NPP leaders.\nParliamentary debates on vital national problems such as debt restructuring must not be polluted with platform rhetoric and partisan politics. It is hoped that Parliament will have a proper debate on the debt issue, and adopt a consensual approach to economic recovery instead of giving a fillip to anti-politics, which is menacingly on the rise.\n\n','Editorial','2024-07-03','http://island.lk/issues-non-issues-and-non-sequiturs/',NULL),(6,_binary 'fŒN\è*T‚Å˜D','Of that debt debate','Tuesday 2nd July, 2024 Parliament is to have a debate on the recently-concluded external debt restructuring agreement between Sri Lanka and some of its foreign creditors.

Parliamentary [&#8230;]','Tuesday 2nd July, 2024\n\nParliament is to have a debate on the recently-concluded external debt restructuring agreement between Sri Lanka and some of its foreign creditors. It is hoped that the focus of the House will remain undivided on the countryâ€™s debt crisis and the ways and means of overcoming it, and nothing else. Parliamentary debates usually descend into slanging matches.\nOpinion is divided on the aforesaid agreement which the government has made out to be a huge success. The Opposition has dismissed it as a sellout, claiming that the government has agreed to conditions totally unfavourable to the country. The truth, we believe, is somewhere between these two extreme positions.\nThe debt structuring agreement has provided Sri Lanka with some respite, but by no stretch of the imagination can it be considered an achievement worthy of celebration. Sriâ€ˆLankaâ€™s International Sovereign Bonds have not yet been restructured; the government is hopeful that an agreement with the bondholders can be reached. There is a long way to go before we achieve debt sustainability, the be-all and end-all of breaking the back of the current crisis, and putting the economy back on an even keel. This is a gargantuan task that requires a substantial increase in the countryâ€™s export revenue and a drastic reduction in the outflow of foreign exchange, among other things.\nThe Oppositionâ€™s position on external debt restructuring smacks of a mindset that the foreign creditors must be penalised for Sri Lankaâ€™s blunders which have brought about the current crisis. True, Sri Lanka would have gained hugely if its creditors had been made to agree to big haircuts and other such extreme measures, but the question is whether it would have been able to borrow again from external sources in such an eventuality.\nHow can the foreign creditors be expected to be so considerate as to take huge haircuts for the sake of Sri Lanka while some local trade unions are demanding their pound of flesh or even more, and the MPs are all out to secure duty-free vehicle permits, which will be a drain on the countryâ€™s foreign currency reserves? Worse, Sri Lankan exporters stand accused of parking their export proceeds overseas.\nMeanwhile, the crisis we are facing is multi-factorial although our focus is only on the economic aspects thereof. Therefore, our efforts to solve it once and for all should not be limited to the economic front. The need for social and political reforms to prepare the country for doing what needs to be done to overcome the present crisis cannot be overemphasised. We are without a work ethic as such and our attitude to work, as a nation, is appalling, to say the least; it is only natural that our national productivity remains woefully low, and we continue to be dependent on foreign aid.\nIdeally, the government and the Opposition should have got together to help resolve the countryâ€™s worst-ever economic crisis, and formulated a recovery strategy, instead of playing politics with the issue. In fact, all members of the current Parliament are duty bound to make a collective effort to hoist the country out of its debt crisis. The SLPP government on Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s watch precipitated the economic crisis, but successive governments have contributed to the countryâ€™s unsustainable debt, albeit to varying degrees. Those in the current Opposition were in the Yahapalana  government or were supportive of that regime, which borrowed more than USD 10 billion between 2015 and 2019, according to SLPP Leader and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The SJB MPs were in the UNP at the time. The TNA, the JVP, etc., fully backed the Yahapalana administration, and even prevented its collapse in 2018 by helping it muster a parliamentary majority. Besides, the TNA backed the LTTE, which inflicted incalculable damage on the economy, and the JVP itself destroyed state assets worth billions of rupees in the late 1980s.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe has expressed his willingness to consider alternative proposals outlining a viable strategy to overcome the debt crisis. He has invited the Opposition to submit such proposals, if any, and undertaken to facilitate a meeting between the proponents thereof and the IMF representatives. Will the Opposition take up the challenge and present an alternative plan when the debt deals are taken up for debate?','Editorial','2024-07-02','http://island.lk/of-that-debt-debate/',NULL),(7,_binary 'fŒN\é*T‚Å˜E','Storm petrel pinioned','Monday 1st July, 2024 The law finally caught up with former MP Hirunika Premachandra on Friday.

One may recall how an otherwise amiable Ranjan Ramanayake behaved during the Yahapalana  government, telephoning and instructing even high-ranking police officers until he was humbled by the judiciary; he was imprisoned for contempt of court. The sobering reality dawned on him while he was serving time.\nHirunika has been a storm petrel of sorts. She was instrumental in exposing the defectus or vulnerability of the Rajapaksa fortress, as it were, and instilling anti-government protesters with confidence that it could be brought down like the Walls of Jericho. On 05 March 2022, she held a womenâ€™s protest near the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s Mirihana residence, and emboldened others to do likewise. She also staged a protest near the Presidentâ€™s House, Fort, on 06 July 2022, about three days before thousands of anti-government activists stormed the place, making President Rajapaksa head for the hills. She also incurred the wrath of the leaders of the incumbent dispensation by launching scathing verbal attacks on them and their close friends.\nThe killers of The Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickremetunge, popular sportsman, Wasim Thajudeen, and several others have not been brought to justice. The tardiness of police investigations into those crimes reminds us of a popular Avurudu cycling contest, where the slowest rider is adjudged the winner, and the contestants do their darndest to move as slow as possible. New foreign exchange control laws were introduced in 2017, and about 30 fraudsters who would have faced incarceration got away with the criminal offences they had committed under the previous Act, which had more teeth. Politicians who make a vulgar display of their wealth, despite their humble beginnings, have the last laugh when legal action is taken against them after regime changes.\nThe taxman looks the other way, and the national anti-graft commission is not equal to the task of prosecuting them properly. Above all, those who plunged the country into a bloodbath in the late 1980s, snuffing out thousands of lives, destroying public property worth billions of rupees, robbing banks and the public, and the perpetrators of equally heinous crimes in the name of counterterror have got off scot-free. A man who trespassed on a former Presidentâ€™s estate, and stole a few coconuts was shot the other day, but the Presidents, who are accused of indulging in corrupt practices, abusing power, jeopardising national security and ruining the economy, are looked after the by the State until they go the way of all flesh.\nThere are many politicians who are â€˜more equal than othersâ€™ before the law like the Pigs in Orwellâ€™s dystopian novella, Animal Farm. If only the law applied equally to everyone in this country.\nThe judicial gavel blow that has shocked Hirunika into realising that she is not above the law is most welcome, and it is hoped that it will serve as a deterrent for others of her ilk. However, on witnessing the prevailing culture of impunity, the selective law enforcement, and the shameful impotence of the long arm of the law and the state prosecutors vis-Ã -vis powerful politicians and their kith and kin, we cannot but echo the words of Mr. Bumble in Oliver Twistâ€” â€˜The law is an assâ€™.','Editorial','2024-06-30','http://island.lk/storm-petrel-pinioned/',NULL),(8,_binary 'fŒN\é*T‚Å˜F','Business as usual','President Ranil Wickremesingheâ€™s address to the nation last Wednesday was a clear indication that Sri Lankaâ€™s political establishment is back to business as usual in these pre-election weeks.

A deafening roar of firecrackers lighted by UNP supporters and RW aficionados plus the kiributh feasts served in many places by political aspirants looking ahead towards next yearâ€™s general election followed the presidentâ€™s declaration that the economic repair job he had undertaken following the 2022 aragalaya is well on track.\nThis optimism was certainly not reflected in the Colombo stock market which was fairly sharply down on Thursday with the declining trend continuing on Friday too as this is being written. Apologists said the market had already factored forward movement on the resolution of the external debt problem these past many weeks to explain away the downturn despite the presidentâ€™s favourable spin.\nFirecrackers and kiributh are very much a part of Sri Lankaâ€™s election scene and political culture. Some had expected the president, during last weekâ€™s address, to formally declare his candidacy for the election to be announced in July and probably held some time in October. Although Wickremesinghe stopped short of saying he would be running, he took advantage of the platform to tilt at Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, both declared candidates and likely front runners at the forthcoming contest.\nPredictably there was no finger pointing at the Rajapaksas who had enthroned him and keeps him in office. He obviously desists from upsetting any apple cart as the SLPP continues with the cat and mouse game of saying theyâ€™ll run at the election but refrains from naming a candidate. The Rajapaksas are also unhappy about many of their members throwing their weight behind the incumbent president.\nWickremesinghe himself would not have expected a broad national audience to closely follow a very long speech peppered with technical jargon. Whether orchestrated or not, the state media highlighted the positives, as it always does or must do, while publishing the full text of the speech most readers are unlikely to wade through. But the president correctly assesses that he has been credited in the public mind for hauling the nation out of the deep pit into which his predecessors had pushed it.\nWho after all can forget the miles long petrol and diesel queues, the gas queues and power cuts that are no longer with us. While the rupee has appreciated against the dollar, consumers have little respite in terms of reduction of prices of imported goods. Periodic announcements of inflation numbers are not reflected in the market place.\nThe president has not tired of the vel paalama (bridge built with creepers) analogy he has borrowed from Bertolt Brechtâ€™s The Caucasian Chalk Circle. He used it again last Wednesday to claim that he had safely carried endangered Mother Lanka across a precipitous abyss. From all that he said, it is clear Sri Lanka is nowhere out of the woods though he naturally presented the existing picture in the most favourable light possible.\nWeâ€™ve been granted considerable time to repay our bilateral debt installments for a period stretching from 2028 to 2043 â€œon concessional terms.â€ But there was no specific mention of â€˜haircutsâ€™ (reduction of capital payable) or reduced interest rates.\nAlso, the Official Creditors Committee (OCC) with whom the Paris deal was struck has called for details on the arrangement with China which too was signed last week. China was not a participant but was present as an observer during the OCC process. The information now sought by OCC, it has been said, is to ensure that all creditors are accorded comparable treatment.\nThe total picture will, no doubt, become clearer when the details of the arrangements that have been finalized are presented to parliament on July 2 when a special session has been summoned. The debate must necessarily present a more balanced picture that an ex parte statement.\nThere is no denying a forward movement on the economic front but that has come at a price. While the people are taxed to boost government revenue, there are no signs whatever of any serious effort of reducing numbers in the public service bloated by political patronage over a very long period of time. A large number of demands for substantial increases in public sector wages are on the table. But these are not demands that can be granted given the current state of the public exchequer.\nMeanwhile protests, strikes, water cannons and teargas are frequent occurrences. Thankfully money printing that seriously eroded peopleâ€™s savings is now no more so there can be no resort to the printing press which was a fact of life in the not so distant past.\nDo those demanding higher wages which the government cannot afford to grant realize that they are among the fortunate salaried and pensionable public servants? Nobody can deny that living on a government salary is not easy in the climate of ever rising prices. But do teachers, for example, ever think of their own shortcomings that have driven a large proportion of the school going population to the clutches of the private tuition industry? How many of them are beneficiaries of that industry?','Editorial','2024-06-29','http://island.lk/business-as-usual/',NULL),(9,_binary 'fŒN\é*T‚Å˜G','A coup that was not','Saturday 29th June, 2024 Bolivia, on Wednesday, was shaken by what looked like the onset of a military coup.

Acting under the command of the head of the armed forces [&#8230;]','Saturday 29th June, 2024\nBolivia, on Wednesday, was shaken by what looked like the onset of a military coup. A large number of soldiers rushed in armoured vehicles and stormed the Murillo Square in the capital, La Paz, where key government institutions are located. Acting under the command of the head of the armed forces General Juan JosÃ© ZÃºÃ±iga, they attempted to force themselves into the Presidentâ€™s House by smashing down a wall. In a dramatic turn of events, the beleaguered President Louis Arce put up resistance intrepidly much to the surprise of everyone. He went on to appoint a new military commander, and the police arrested ZÃºÃ±iga. Order was restored in about three hours.\nBolivia is no stranger to military coups and has its share of generals with political ambitions. In 2019, the military stepped in to oust President Evo Morales following a disputed election outcome, paving the way for the appointment of an interim President. Arce became the President in 2020. Morales, who came to power in 2006, riding on a wave of popularity, endeared himself to the Bolivian public by undertaking to share in their suffering. He and his ministers took pay cuts and their approval rating shot up. But after being ensconced in power, Morales failed to live up to peopleâ€™s expectations and had to leave amidst public protests.\nInterestingly, General ZÃºÃ±iga told reporters, on Wednesday, that he had staged the â€˜coupâ€™ at the behest of President Arce himself! The incident has since come to be known as a â€˜self-coupâ€™ in some quarters. Whether the Generalâ€™s claim is true or false, one may not know, but the manner in which the â€˜coupâ€™ unfolded and ended, and the sangfroid of President Arce and his Cabinet have given rise to doubts and suspicions in the minds of Bolivians as well as others.\nSome political commentators are of the view that ZÃºÃ±iga has told the truth. They point out that President Arce is troubled by the prospect of having to face a popular uprising soon. His popularity is on the wane due to his governmentâ€™s inability to manage the floundering economy, which is reeling from a biting foreign exchange crisis caused by a drastic drop in gas exports. Wednesdayâ€™s â€˜coupâ€™ unified all those across the political spectrum, in Bolivia, including former President Morales, a bitter critic of the incumbent government; it has enabled Arce to rally public support, and shore up his image. ZÃºÃ±iga has also alleged Morales is planning to run for President despite a constitutionally-stipulated term limit and the latter has to be stopped.\nBolivia and other democratic nations heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday when the â€˜coupâ€™ came to an end, but socio-economic factors that have the potential to trigger an uprising and creating conditions for a real military intervention in the form of another coup remain in the Andean state, where public resentment is said to be palpable. Trouble is therefore far from over. Wednesdayâ€™s incident may be considered a foretaste of what is to come.\nAmbitious generals usually capitalise on public resentment and economic crises to project themselves as saviours and grab state power, as has been the experience of many countries in Latin America. They also do so at the instigation of foreign powers, the bloody overthrow of Salvador Allendeâ€™s democratically-elected, progressive government in Chile, one of Boliviaâ€™s neighbours, in 1973, being a case in point. The Bolivian Opposition and human rights groups have expressed fear that President Arce will use Wednesdayâ€™s incident to launch a campaign to suppress the Opposition. Arrests continue to be made, according to international media reports.\nAllâ€™s well that ends well, but it is hoped that the apparent coup in Bolivia will serve as a warning to all other nations which are facing similar political, social and economic problems, and that their leaders will refrain from provoking the public into staging uprisings and providing ambitious generals with opportunities to make forays into politics. The problem with political power is it is highly addictive like narcotics, and one who saviours it does not want to let go of it.','Editorial','2024-06-28','http://island.lk/a-coup-that-was-not/',NULL);

Addressing a group of community police members in Wellawaya, on Saturday, he expressed serious concern about the practice of human rights activists and lawyers rising in defence of drug lords taken into custody. Opinion may be divided on this score, but the Presidentâ€™s concern undoubtedly resonates with the public, given the increasing severity of the drug menace, which has engulfed even schools; the victims of the drug Mafia are without anyone to fight for their human rights!\nPresident Wickremesinghe also highlighted the inadequacies of the existing anti-drug laws, and stressed the need for new ones to fight the drug Mafia effectively. He pointed out that countries like Singapore had adopted extreme measures such as the death penalty to tackle the drug problem. One cannot but agree that there is a pressing need for strong laws in this country to protect the public against drug dealers. However, even such laws, unless enforced strictly, will serve little purpose.\nThe police embarked on a much-hyped campaign to neutralise the crime syndicates involved in drug trafficking, etc., amidst claims in some quarters that it caused human rights violations. But we believe that the anti-drug operations must go on, as they have yielded huge amounts of narcotics and helped weaken the distribution network to a considerable extent. Care must be taken to leave no room for excesses.\nHowever, the drug problem is best tackled at source. The ongoing efforts to thwart drug smuggling via sea routes have to be redoubled; a watchful eye must be kept on the countryâ€™s ports, where huge consignments of drugs have been detected. A large number of fishing craft used for drug trafficking have been taken into custody with their crew members. Increasing naval patrol to hold drug smugglers at bay, we believe, will be half the battle in breaking the back of the narcotic problem. The Navy and the Coastguard must be provided with more vessels, personnel and technology to intensify their effective anti-drug operations.\nDrug barons use a fraction of their ill-gotten wealth to retain the best lawyers in the country, bribe corrupt politicians and rogues in uniform and thereby put paid to efforts to make them pay for their crimes. The integrity of the drug testing process is also in doubt, and allegations abound that narcotic samples are tampered with.\nA notorious drug dealer, known as Kanjipani Imran, fled the country after being enlarged on bail. Many criminals like him are running their drug cartels here from overseas, and the need for new laws to prevent them being bailed out cannot be overstated. Imran is believed to have used various fronts to launder his drug money here and abroad. These dangerous characters, operating from faraway countries, are capable of having anyone physically eliminated here, as evident from the numerous killings committed at their behest. They have emerged so powerful that, a few months ago, they planned a commando-type operation with inside help to remove two drug kingpins from the CID headquarters, where they were being detained at the time. Thankfully, their plan went awry. This shows that while the issue of inadequacies and paucity of anti-drug laws are addressed urgently, much more remains to be done to eliminate the narcotic trade, which serves as a wellspring for numerous crimes and poses a threat to national security as well.\nMeanwhile, drug dealers are known to use their slush funds to bankroll election campaigns of some influential politicians. The rise of the narcotic Mafia is attributable to the nexus between drug kingpins and politicians. Hence the need to ensure transparency and accountability in respect of campaign funding while new anti-drug laws with more teeth are made and action is taken to weed out the rogues in uniform in the pay of the drug barons.','Editorial','2024-07-07','http://island.lk/drugs-criminals-and-human-rights/',NULL),(1,_binary 'fŒQ*T‚Å˜V','Whodunnit?','President Ranil Wickremesinghe was quick to dissociate himself from the Fundamental Rights action on the forthcoming election filed in the Supreme Court last week by an unknown private citizen whose name, Chamindra Dayan Lenawa, was published in all the newspapers and electronic media bulletins that ran the story. No doubt the president was well aware [&#8230;]','President Ranil Wickremesinghe was quick to dissociate himself from the Fundamental Rights action on the forthcoming election filed in the Supreme Court last week by an unknown private citizen whose name, Chamindra Dayan Lenawa, was published in all the newspapers and electronic media bulletins that ran the story. No doubt the president was well aware of a suspicion in the public mind that he was behind the court action which sought a SC order that no election be held until the correct constitutional position regrading such an election was determined by the court.\nHence the alacrity with which the Presidential Media Division (PMD) sought to rubbish the story. The first message said neither the president nor his lawyers had been consulted by the litigant. The second stressed that Wickremesinghe was firmly of the view that the presidential term was for five years. It is on that basis that the Elections Commission is preparing to hold the poll later this year.\nIt was reported on Friday that the chief justice had appointed a fuller five-judge bench chaired by himself to hear the case which will be taken up on Monday. Doubtlessly there will be public interest on the arguments urged in favour of not holding an election until the constitutional position is properly determined. These, of course, were set out in the petition itself. Peopleâ€™s Action for Free and Fair Election (PAFREL) has already said it will be an intervenient petitioner. Also the Attorney General has been cited as the seventh respondent in the matter and it is unlikely that his stance will be any different from the presidentâ€™s.\nThe chances are that an early determination will be made to clear whatever uncertainty there may be. Both Opposition/SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and NPP/JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, declared candidates for the forthcoming election, as well as other political activists have alleged that Wickremesinghe is behind the FR action. The president has not yet formally declared his own candidacy although his intimates are on public record that he will run.\nAlso posters are up and advertising time bought to proclaim â€œRanil is the man for now.â€ The wide perception is that heâ€™s a runner, but that is not a certainty. Relevantly, business tycoon Dhammika Perera who has expressed an interest in running as the SLPP candidate also appears to be keeping the ball in play by projecting his DP Education endeavour giving free distance education in Information Technology (IT) to young people. It has been claimed that the project has attracted over a million participants. Though the president and Perera not so long ago appeared to be adversaries, Wickremesinghe was recently chief guestat a DP Education function at Nelun Pokuna.\nAlthough the SLPP, the Rajapaksa party which elected Wickremesinghe president, have been waffling for the past several weeks, neither saying whether they are, nor they are not backing Wickremesingheâ€™s candidature, there was a further development last week. That was when when SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam went public with the assertion that Ranil â€œwill be considered for SLPP nominationâ€ if he quits the UNP and joins their party. The SLPP, of course, cannot be happy that many of their members are appearing on Wickremesinghe platforms. Our stablemate, The Island, last Thursday ran a lead story on its front page saying the â€œSLPP â€“ UNP alliance on the verge of collapse.â€ This alliance, as everybody knows, is what is ruling the country right now.\nThat report quoted UNP Chairman, Wajiira Abeywardene, MP, responding to a question on his partyâ€™s stance on Kariyawasamâ€™s statement saying that they would await a comment from from former president Mahinda Rajapaksa on this matter. He, after all, is leader of the SLPP. But it is generally perceived that Kariyawasam is the mouthpiece for Basil Rajapaksa, the founder/strategist of that party and onetime national organizer. Indications at present is that Wickremesinghe, unless he pulls out before nomination day, will run as an independent candidate with backing from various sections of the polity rather than under the UNP and its elephant symbol. Heâ€™s been recently courting such support with a degree of success. Several SLPPers, both cabinet ministers and backbenchers, have gone public that they are backing Wickremesinghe. They credit him for pulling the country out of the post Aragalaya doldrums an achieving a degree of normalcy and stress that his steady hand is required on the tiller for a further term.\nThe law provides for defectors elected on one party ticket joining another being expelled from their original party endangering their parliamentary seats. But parties have not resorted to this possibility in recent times. There is a due process, justiciable by the courts, that must precede expulsion. However, that sleeping dog has been allowed to lie by most political parties in recent times despite numerous defections.','Editorial','2024-07-06','http://island.lk/whodunnit/',NULL),(2,_binary 'fŒQ*T‚Å˜W','Darley Road puppet show','Saturday 6th July, 2024 Time was when the SLFP and the UNP dominated Sri Lankan politics, and captured power almost alternately so much so that we had a two-party system to all intents and purposes.

But today they have become shadows of their former selves and are struggling for survival. Worse, their offshoots have not only overtaken them but also rendered them almost irrelevant in national politics.\nThe UNP is lucky that the elevation of its leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, to the presidency, albeit fortuitously, has enabled it to recover some lost ground on the political front. But the SLFP continues to sink in a political mire of its own making apparently with no prospect of recovery anytime soon.\nIn what can be considered a dramatic turn of events, MP Dayasiri Jayasekera, who obtained an interim order from the Colombo District Court against the SLFPâ€™s decision to strip him of party membership and the post of General Secretary, assumed duties in front of the SLFP Headquarters at Darley Road, Colombo 10, yesterday. The police did not allow him to enter the party office.\nNo sooner had the interim order in question been issued than Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, whom the Chandrika faction of the SLFP appointed as the party Chairman, sacked Jayasekera. Now, there are two persons staking claims to the SLFP chairmanshipâ€”Minister de Silva and Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha. There are three persons who claim to be the SLFP General Secretaryâ€”Jayasekera, Dushmantha Mitrapala and Duminda Dissanayake. The partyâ€™s rank and file are confused and frustrated; many of them have already voted with their feet. Most of the SLFP MPs, elected on the SLPP ticket, have switched their allegiance to President Wickremesinghe.\nFormer President Maithripala Sirisena, who resigned as the SLFP Chairman, is pulling the strings. Ex-President Kumaratunga is doing likewise. Their proxies are at war. The unfolding Darley Road drama is like an Ambalangoda rookada (puppet) show.\nThe police are all out to ensure that the rivals of the Chandrika faction do not gain access to the SLFP party office. It is obvious that they are doing so at the behest of the powers that be. The anti-Sirisena faction of the SLFP supports President Wickremesinghe. Sirisena and his loyalists were planning to field Minister Rajapaksha as the SLFPâ€™s presidential candidate. Their attempt has been in vain; their rivals have gained the upper hand with the help of the police, and others.\nThe SLFP is no stranger to internecine legal battles among its ambitious leaders. Even some members of the Bandaranaike family failed to be different, and as a result the SLFP remained in the political wilderness for 17 years, after its humiliating defeat at the 1977 general election.\nThe SLFP has had two of its General Secretaries decampingâ€”S. B. Dissanayake in 2001 and Sirisena in late 2014. In 2005, the then President Kumaratunga sought to queer the pitch for the SLFPâ€™s presidential candidate, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had ruffled her feathers. She failed in her endeavour. Ten years later, President Sirisena ruined the SLFP-led UPFAâ€™s chances of winning a general election, as he had an axe to grind with Mahinda, who was the partyâ€™s prime ministerial candidate at the time. The SLFP has not recovered from the crippling split it suffered due to clashes between the then Sirisena-Kumaratunga faction, which sided with the UNP, and the Rajapaksa loyalists.\nThe SLFP is in the current predicament because its leaders never hesitate to subjugate its interests to their personal agendas. Whichever faction emerges victorious in the intraparty war at Darley Road, the SLFP will lose, for at this rate it is likely to end up being a mere nameboard, having lost significance, influence and following.','Editorial','2024-07-05','http://island.lk/darley-road-puppet-show/',NULL),(3,_binary 'fŒQ*T‚Å˜X','Keep genie in bottle','Friday 5th July, 2024 A person described as an entrepreneur from Moratuwa has filed a fundamental rights (FR) petition, seeking a Supreme Court (SC) determination on the duration of the presidentâ€™s term, and an interim order preventing the official announcement of the next presidential election until the apex court decision. The members of the Election [&#8230;]','Friday 5th July, 2024\nA person described as an entrepreneur from Moratuwa has filed a fundamental rights (FR) petition, seeking a Supreme Court (SC) determination on the duration of the presidentâ€™s term, and an interim order preventing the official announcement of the next presidential election until the apex court decision. The members of the Election Commission (EC) including its Chairman and the Attorney General have been named as respondents. This petition has not come as a surprise. We are reminded of a vain attempt President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga made in 2005 to remain in office until 2006.\nWe thought the Constitution was very clear on the duration of the presidential term. Otherwise, the EC would not have undertaken to hold the presidential election this year itself. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected, in 2019, for a period of five years, and following his resignation in 2022, Parliament elected Ranil Wickremesinghe as his successor to serve the remainder of his term. We, however, do not intend to dwell on the legal aspects of a matter that is before the SC. They are best left to the learned judges. Instead, we discuss the political, social and economic issues that arise from poll postponements.\nThe Opposition is letting out howls of protest against surreptitious moves being made to postpone the upcoming presidential election. It has vowed to do everything in its power to defeat them on both political and legal fronts. The SJB, the JVP/NPP, and the SLPP dissidents have said they will come forward as intervenient petitioners in respect of the FR petition at issue. One cannot but appreciate their concerns about democracy and action to counter threats to the peopleâ€™s franchise. They can rest assured that every right-thinking person, who cherishes democracy, will be on their side. (In this country, politicians fight for the peopleâ€™s democratic rights only when they happen to be in the Opposition!)\nAttempts to have the next presidential poll put off could prove counterproductive, for they are bound to go pear-shaped, and will be seen as proof that those who are behind them are afraid of facing elections.\nThe Presidential Media Division has issued a statement that President Wickremesinghe is of the view that the EC is right in having decided to hold the next presidential election this year. It has also said the person who filed the aforesaid petition had not consulted either President Wickremesinghe or his lawyers. But it is the UNP which has called for a poll postponement. Its General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara himself has reiterated that the presidential and parliamentary polls have to be put off.\nThe SLPP has claimed that it is against postponing elections. It seems to think that Sri Lankans are suffering from amnesia. It has postponed the Local Government polls twice. There is no bigger threat to democracy than a regime that undermines the peopleâ€™s franchise. Elections not only help the people elect their representatives to run political institutions or govern the country but also enable them to canalise their resentment towards those at the levers of power in a democratic manner.\nPressure that builds up in a polity, where the people undergo unbearable economic hardships and are denied their democratic rights including franchise, or elections do not reflect the popular will due to malpractices, etc., tends to find expression in political upheavals. There have been several instances where poll postponements made Sriâ€ˆLankan democracy scream. If the SLFP-led United Front government had not extended the life of Parliament by two years from 1975 to 1977, the UNP would not have been able to obtain a steamroller majority, which it abused in every conceivable manner to suppress democracy.\nThe scrapping of a general election due in 1982 with the help of a heavily-rigged referendum, under J. R. Jayewardeneâ€™s presidency, paved the way for the second JVP uprising and a bloodbath. Thousands of young lives were lost and state assets worth billions of rupees destroyed. The social and economic costs of the JVPâ€™s reign of terror and the UNPâ€™s equally savage counterterror operations were incalculable. The Gotabaya Rajapaksa government also blundered by putting off the LG polls. If they had been held on schedule, they would have allowed the public to give vent to their pent-up anger democratically, forcing that blundering regime to heed public opinion and make a course correction without provoking the people into taking to the streets. The postponement of the LG polls last year on President Ranil Wickremesingheâ€™s watch has also created a massive pressure build-up, which has the potential to erupt into an uprising. Another poll postponement will make the situation even more volatile.\nLet those who are making a last-ditch attempt to delay the presidential election be warned that they are playing with fire. They had better recall that the Rajapaksas, who preened themselves on having defeated terrorism, had to head for the hills in 2022 as they, in their wisdom, chose to slight public opinion and ride roughshod over the people.

Therefore, the EC has warned that at present nobody must promote any specific candidate, political party, or independent group. It has also informed all heads of public institutions, through a circular and a gazette extraordinary, that no state property must be utilised for this purpose. The ECâ€™s actions and warning are timely; complaints abound that the politicians who have submitted nominations for the LG polls are involved in the presidential election campaigns of their political parties. The government stands accused of involving its LG polls candidates in state-funded development activities at the grassroots level so that they can gain political mileage while carrying out its presidential election campaign.\nSome political parties, such as the UNP, the SJB and the NPP, are busy promoting themselves as well as their prospective presidential candidates in view of the next presidential election, which has not yet been called officially. These political parties have submitted nominations for the deferred LG polls, and therefore it can be argued that they are violating the election laws. Arenâ€™t there sufficient grounds for legal action to be taken against them?\nInterestingly, the laws governing the LG and presidential polls will overlap soon when the EC declares the next presidential election. This unprecedented situation could raise a legal dilemma. Will the presidential election laws take precedence over those governing the LG polls, or will the LG election laws apply only to the LG candidates, excluding the political parties and independent groups they represent, in the run-up to the upcoming presidential election? The resulting confusion among the public could undermine the integrity of the election laws and the electoral process besides eroding public trust therein. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a clarification.\nAll election laws prohibit the misuse or abuse of public property for electioneering, but some questionable practices are prevalent, and, worse, they have been taken for granted. The President, the Prime Minister and ministers use government vehicles and even the SLAF aircraft for campaign related activities which are craftily made to look like official engagements. Needless to say, they do so at the expense of the public amidst a crippling economic crisis. These practices that amount to a blatant violation of election laws must be brought to an end; government politicians who misuse the state machinery, the publicly-owned aircraft and vehicles can carry out their election campaigns much more efficiently than their Opposition counterparts at lower costs, leaving the public to foot the bill. Extraordinary security arrangements for government bigwigsâ€™ travel throughout the country also cost the public an arm and a leg. If the existing laws do not provide for banning such practices, new ones must be brought in to ensure a level playing field for all candidates. Curiously, this issue has not been taken up in Parliament. Maybe the Opposition has chosen to remain silent because it is hoping to do likewise in the event of being voted into power.\nIt defies comprehension why the President, the Prime Minister, ministers and the Opposition Leader should be allowed to use their official vehicles, etc., for political work even during non-election times. They must be prevented from misusing state assets and public funds for their political work. They have a right to engage in politics but at their own expense, and the public, already crushed under multiple burdens including unconscionably high taxes, must not be made to pay through the nose to meet unnecessary expenses. The peopleâ€™s predicament, which in fact is a double whammy caused by spendthrift, inefficient politicians, is like Saturn, the evildoer, landing in a beggarâ€™s bowl, as a local saying goes.','Editorial','2024-07-04','http://island.lk/ec-in-cockpit-saturn-in-beggars-bowl/',NULL),(5,_binary 'fŒQ*T‚Å˜Z','Issues, non-issues and non sequiturs','Wednesday 3rd July, 2024 The SJB parliamentary group yesterday unanimously resolved that it would not join a national government under President Ranil Wickremesingheâ€™s leadership.

What prompted it to make such a resolution suddenly is not clear. Perhaps, it has only reiterated its response to an invitation President Wickremesinghe extended about two years ago.\nOne cannot but agree that there is absolutely no need for a national government, for such an arrangement does not benefit the public in a half-baked democracy like Sri Lanka, where politicians are driven by self-interest; they join forces to further their own interests and not for the sake of the country. The so-called national unity government formed by the UNP and the SLFP-led UPFA in 2015 is a case in point. That administration, which was a coming together of a bunch of strange bedfellows, was characterised by mega scams, other forms of corruption, the aggravation of the countryâ€™s indebtedness, inefficiency and the neglect of national security. It exemplified the popular saying that two dogs at the same bone seldom agree. Competing interests and personality clashes led to tensions among its leaders, and President Sirisena sought to dislodge it eventually, albeit in vain.\nWhat Sri Lanka needs is a national-minded government as well as a national-minded Opposition. The ruling coalition is all out to retain power, and the Opposition parties are doing their darndest to capture power, and the national interest does not figure in their agendas. The country is grappling with its worst-ever economic crisis, which has adversely impacted every facet of life, but the government and the Opposition are pulling in different directions oblivious to the need for a concerted effort. Sriâ€ˆLankan political leaders did not join forces even at the height of the Vanni war or in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe made a special statement in Parliament yesterday on the debt restructuring agreements. Much more information about those pacts remains to be disclosed. It is hoped that all agreements will be made available to the public after the restructuring of ISBs (International Sovereign Bonds). The Opposition claimed that Sri Lankaâ€™s creditors had not been made to take haircuts.\nThe so-called peopleâ€™s representatives in Sri Lanka are not prepared to forgo their duty-free vehicle permits and other such perks, much less share in the suffering of the public in any manner, but the Opposition politicians want the countryâ€™s creditors to take haircuts. They are of the same mindset as inveterate delinquent cardholders who inveigh against their banks after living beyond their means and finding themselves in dire financial straits. Loans have to be paid back. Let that be the bottom line.\nParliament should debate all vital agreements related to debt restructuring, but at the same time it ought to discuss ways and means of shoring up the countryâ€™s foreign exchange reserves, enhancing national productivity, boosting exports, combating corruption, curtailing waste and rationalising state expenditure. The government deserves the flak it is receiving, but the Opposition does not provide alternative solutions to the countryâ€™s burning issues; it only bellows rhetoric, mouths populist slogans, and advocates clientelism and welfarism. Instead of taking action to eliminate corruption in the Customs, Inland Revenue and the Exercise Department and cast the tax net wide, the government is bent on squeezing the public dry. The Opposition is promising tax cuts and freebies to the public in a bid to garner votes at the upcoming election. The SJB has undertaken to allocate more funds for education, healthcare, social welfare, etc., but it will not reveal how it is going to increase state revenue. The JVP/NPP has promised to grab power from the â€˜corrupt political elitesâ€™ and hand it over to the youth! It tried to do so on two occasionsâ€”in 1971 and in the late 1980sâ€”and left thousands of youth dead. Elites circulate, according to thinkers like Pareto, and one sees no difference between the traditional political elites and the JVP/NPP leaders.\nParliamentary debates on vital national problems such as debt restructuring must not be polluted with platform rhetoric and partisan politics. It is hoped that Parliament will have a proper debate on the debt issue, and adopt a consensual approach to economic recovery instead of giving a fillip to anti-politics, which is menacingly on the rise.\n\n','Editorial','2024-07-03','http://island.lk/issues-non-issues-and-non-sequiturs/',NULL),(6,_binary 'fŒQ*T‚Å˜[','Of that debt debate','Tuesday 2nd July, 2024 Parliament is to have a debate on the recently-concluded external debt restructuring agreement between Sri Lanka and some of its foreign creditors.

Parliamentary [&#8230;]','Tuesday 2nd July, 2024\n\nParliament is to have a debate on the recently-concluded external debt restructuring agreement between Sri Lanka and some of its foreign creditors. It is hoped that the focus of the House will remain undivided on the countryâ€™s debt crisis and the ways and means of overcoming it, and nothing else. Parliamentary debates usually descend into slanging matches.\nOpinion is divided on the aforesaid agreement which the government has made out to be a huge success. The Opposition has dismissed it as a sellout, claiming that the government has agreed to conditions totally unfavourable to the country. The truth, we believe, is somewhere between these two extreme positions.\nThe debt structuring agreement has provided Sri Lanka with some respite, but by no stretch of the imagination can it be considered an achievement worthy of celebration. Sriâ€ˆLankaâ€™s International Sovereign Bonds have not yet been restructured; the government is hopeful that an agreement with the bondholders can be reached. There is a long way to go before we achieve debt sustainability, the be-all and end-all of breaking the back of the current crisis, and putting the economy back on an even keel. This is a gargantuan task that requires a substantial increase in the countryâ€™s export revenue and a drastic reduction in the outflow of foreign exchange, among other things.\nThe Oppositionâ€™s position on external debt restructuring smacks of a mindset that the foreign creditors must be penalised for Sri Lankaâ€™s blunders which have brought about the current crisis. True, Sri Lanka would have gained hugely if its creditors had been made to agree to big haircuts and other such extreme measures, but the question is whether it would have been able to borrow again from external sources in such an eventuality.\nHow can the foreign creditors be expected to be so considerate as to take huge haircuts for the sake of Sri Lanka while some local trade unions are demanding their pound of flesh or even more, and the MPs are all out to secure duty-free vehicle permits, which will be a drain on the countryâ€™s foreign currency reserves? Worse, Sri Lankan exporters stand accused of parking their export proceeds overseas.\nMeanwhile, the crisis we are facing is multi-factorial although our focus is only on the economic aspects thereof. Therefore, our efforts to solve it once and for all should not be limited to the economic front. The need for social and political reforms to prepare the country for doing what needs to be done to overcome the present crisis cannot be overemphasised. We are without a work ethic as such and our attitude to work, as a nation, is appalling, to say the least; it is only natural that our national productivity remains woefully low, and we continue to be dependent on foreign aid.\nIdeally, the government and the Opposition should have got together to help resolve the countryâ€™s worst-ever economic crisis, and formulated a recovery strategy, instead of playing politics with the issue. In fact, all members of the current Parliament are duty bound to make a collective effort to hoist the country out of its debt crisis. The SLPP government on Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s watch precipitated the economic crisis, but successive governments have contributed to the countryâ€™s unsustainable debt, albeit to varying degrees. Those in the current Opposition were in the Yahapalana  government or were supportive of that regime, which borrowed more than USD 10 billion between 2015 and 2019, according to SLPP Leader and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The SJB MPs were in the UNP at the time. The TNA, the JVP, etc., fully backed the Yahapalana administration, and even prevented its collapse in 2018 by helping it muster a parliamentary majority. Besides, the TNA backed the LTTE, which inflicted incalculable damage on the economy, and the JVP itself destroyed state assets worth billions of rupees in the late 1980s.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe has expressed his willingness to consider alternative proposals outlining a viable strategy to overcome the debt crisis. He has invited the Opposition to submit such proposals, if any, and undertaken to facilitate a meeting between the proponents thereof and the IMF representatives. Will the Opposition take up the challenge and present an alternative plan when the debt deals are taken up for debate?','Editorial','2024-07-02','http://island.lk/of-that-debt-debate/',NULL),(7,_binary 'fŒQ*T‚Å˜\\','Storm petrel pinioned','Monday 1st July, 2024 The law finally caught up with former MP Hirunika Premachandra on Friday.

Having been found guilty of the abduction, wrongful detention and assault of a youth in December 2015, and sentenced to three-year RI, she is languishing behind bars. She is expected to appeal against her conviction. As a lawyer, Hirunika should have known better than to take the law into her own hands. What possessed her to commit the crime that has landed her in prison?\nHirunika and several others committed the aforesaid offences during the heyday of the UNP-led Yahapalana government. The UNP-led UNF was ensconced in power and President Maithripala Sirisena was going strong at the time. Hirunika, like the other young UNF MPs in the good books of the government leaders of the day may have thought she was above the law.\nThe problem with political power is that it goes to the heads of those who wield it, and have the same effect as intoxicants on them. Hence, the politicians of the party/coalition in power take leave of their senses and become oblivious to the consequences of their actions. One may recall how an otherwise amiable Ranjan Ramanayake behaved during the Yahapalana  government, telephoning and instructing even high-ranking police officers until he was humbled by the judiciary; he was imprisoned for contempt of court. The sobering reality dawned on him while he was serving time.\nHirunika has been a storm petrel of sorts. She was instrumental in exposing the defectus or vulnerability of the Rajapaksa fortress, as it were, and instilling anti-government protesters with confidence that it could be brought down like the Walls of Jericho. On 05 March 2022, she held a womenâ€™s protest near the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s Mirihana residence, and emboldened others to do likewise. She also staged a protest near the Presidentâ€™s House, Fort, on 06 July 2022, about three days before thousands of anti-government activists stormed the place, making President Rajapaksa head for the hills. She also incurred the wrath of the leaders of the incumbent dispensation by launching scathing verbal attacks on them and their close friends.\nThe killers of The Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickremetunge, popular sportsman, Wasim Thajudeen, and several others have not been brought to justice. The tardiness of police investigations into those crimes reminds us of a popular Avurudu cycling contest, where the slowest rider is adjudged the winner, and the contestants do their darndest to move as slow as possible. New foreign exchange control laws were introduced in 2017, and about 30 fraudsters who would have faced incarceration got away with the criminal offences they had committed under the previous Act, which had more teeth. Politicians who make a vulgar display of their wealth, despite their humble beginnings, have the last laugh when legal action is taken against them after regime changes.\nThe taxman looks the other way, and the national anti-graft commission is not equal to the task of prosecuting them properly. Above all, those who plunged the country into a bloodbath in the late 1980s, snuffing out thousands of lives, destroying public property worth billions of rupees, robbing banks and the public, and the perpetrators of equally heinous crimes in the name of counterterror have got off scot-free. A man who trespassed on a former Presidentâ€™s estate, and stole a few coconuts was shot the other day, but the Presidents, who are accused of indulging in corrupt practices, abusing power, jeopardising national security and ruining the economy, are looked after the by the State until they go the way of all flesh.\nThere are many politicians who are â€˜more equal than othersâ€™ before the law like the Pigs in Orwellâ€™s dystopian novella, Animal Farm. If only the law applied equally to everyone in this country.\nThe judicial gavel blow that has shocked Hirunika into realising that she is not above the law is most welcome, and it is hoped that it will serve as a deterrent for others of her ilk. However, on witnessing the prevailing culture of impunity, the selective law enforcement, and the shameful impotence of the long arm of the law and the state prosecutors vis-Ã -vis powerful politicians and their kith and kin, we cannot but echo the words of Mr. Bumble in Oliver Twistâ€” â€˜The law is an assâ€™.','Editorial','2024-06-30','http://island.lk/storm-petrel-pinioned/',NULL),(8,_binary 'fŒQ*T‚Å˜]','Business as usual','President Ranil Wickremesingheâ€™s address to the nation last Wednesday was a clear indication that Sri Lankaâ€™s political establishment is back to business as usual in these pre-election weeks.

A deafening roar of firecrackers lighted by UNP supporters and RW aficionados plus the kiributh feasts served in many places by political aspirants looking ahead towards next yearâ€™s general election followed the presidentâ€™s declaration that the economic repair job he had undertaken following the 2022 aragalaya is well on track.\nThis optimism was certainly not reflected in the Colombo stock market which was fairly sharply down on Thursday with the declining trend continuing on Friday too as this is being written. Apologists said the market had already factored forward movement on the resolution of the external debt problem these past many weeks to explain away the downturn despite the presidentâ€™s favourable spin.\nFirecrackers and kiributh are very much a part of Sri Lankaâ€™s election scene and political culture. Some had expected the president, during last weekâ€™s address, to formally declare his candidacy for the election to be announced in July and probably held some time in October. Although Wickremesinghe stopped short of saying he would be running, he took advantage of the platform to tilt at Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, both declared candidates and likely front runners at the forthcoming contest.\nPredictably there was no finger pointing at the Rajapaksas who had enthroned him and keeps him in office. He obviously desists from upsetting any apple cart as the SLPP continues with the cat and mouse game of saying theyâ€™ll run at the election but refrains from naming a candidate. The Rajapaksas are also unhappy about many of their members throwing their weight behind the incumbent president.\nWickremesinghe himself would not have expected a broad national audience to closely follow a very long speech peppered with technical jargon. Whether orchestrated or not, the state media highlighted the positives, as it always does or must do, while publishing the full text of the speech most readers are unlikely to wade through. But the president correctly assesses that he has been credited in the public mind for hauling the nation out of the deep pit into which his predecessors had pushed it.\nWho after all can forget the miles long petrol and diesel queues, the gas queues and power cuts that are no longer with us. While the rupee has appreciated against the dollar, consumers have little respite in terms of reduction of prices of imported goods. Periodic announcements of inflation numbers are not reflected in the market place.\nThe president has not tired of the vel paalama (bridge built with creepers) analogy he has borrowed from Bertolt Brechtâ€™s The Caucasian Chalk Circle. He used it again last Wednesday to claim that he had safely carried endangered Mother Lanka across a precipitous abyss. From all that he said, it is clear Sri Lanka is nowhere out of the woods though he naturally presented the existing picture in the most favourable light possible.\nWeâ€™ve been granted considerable time to repay our bilateral debt installments for a period stretching from 2028 to 2043 â€œon concessional terms.â€ But there was no specific mention of â€˜haircutsâ€™ (reduction of capital payable) or reduced interest rates.\nAlso, the Official Creditors Committee (OCC) with whom the Paris deal was struck has called for details on the arrangement with China which too was signed last week. China was not a participant but was present as an observer during the OCC process. The information now sought by OCC, it has been said, is to ensure that all creditors are accorded comparable treatment.\nThe total picture will, no doubt, become clearer when the details of the arrangements that have been finalized are presented to parliament on July 2 when a special session has been summoned. The debate must necessarily present a more balanced picture that an ex parte statement.\nThere is no denying a forward movement on the economic front but that has come at a price. While the people are taxed to boost government revenue, there are no signs whatever of any serious effort of reducing numbers in the public service bloated by political patronage over a very long period of time. A large number of demands for substantial increases in public sector wages are on the table. But these are not demands that can be granted given the current state of the public exchequer.\nMeanwhile protests, strikes, water cannons and teargas are frequent occurrences. Thankfully money printing that seriously eroded peopleâ€™s savings is now no more so there can be no resort to the printing press which was a fact of life in the not so distant past.\nDo those demanding higher wages which the government cannot afford to grant realize that they are among the fortunate salaried and pensionable public servants? Nobody can deny that living on a government salary is not easy in the climate of ever rising prices. But do teachers, for example, ever think of their own shortcomings that have driven a large proportion of the school going population to the clutches of the private tuition industry? How many of them are beneficiaries of that industry?','Editorial','2024-06-29','http://island.lk/business-as-usual/',NULL),(9,_binary 'fŒQ*T‚Å˜^','A coup that was not','Saturday 29th June, 2024 Bolivia, on Wednesday, was shaken by what looked like the onset of a military coup.

A large number of soldiers rushed in armoured vehicles and stormed the Murillo Square in the capital, La Paz, where key government institutions are located. Acting under the command of the head of the armed forces General Juan JosÃ© ZÃºÃ±iga, they attempted to force themselves into the Presidentâ€™s House by smashing down a wall. In a dramatic turn of events, the beleaguered President Louis Arce put up resistance intrepidly much to the surprise of everyone. He went on to appoint a new military commander, and the police arrested ZÃºÃ±iga. Order was restored in about three hours.\nBolivia is no stranger to military coups and has its share of generals with political ambitions. In 2019, the military stepped in to oust President Evo Morales following a disputed election outcome, paving the way for the appointment of an interim President. Arce became the President in 2020. Morales, who came to power in 2006, riding on a wave of popularity, endeared himself to the Bolivian public by undertaking to share in their suffering. He and his ministers took pay cuts and their approval rating shot up. But after being ensconced in power, Morales failed to live up to peopleâ€™s expectations and had to leave amidst public protests.\nInterestingly, General ZÃºÃ±iga told reporters, on Wednesday, that he had staged the â€˜coupâ€™ at the behest of President Arce himself! The incident has since come to be known as a â€˜self-coupâ€™ in some quarters. Whether the Generalâ€™s claim is true or false, one may not know, but the manner in which the â€˜coupâ€™ unfolded and ended, and the sangfroid of President Arce and his Cabinet have given rise to doubts and suspicions in the minds of Bolivians as well as others.\nSome political commentators are of the view that ZÃºÃ±iga has told the truth. They point out that President Arce is troubled by the prospect of having to face a popular uprising soon. His popularity is on the wane due to his governmentâ€™s inability to manage the floundering economy, which is reeling from a biting foreign exchange crisis caused by a drastic drop in gas exports. Wednesdayâ€™s â€˜coupâ€™ unified all those across the political spectrum, in Bolivia, including former President Morales, a bitter critic of the incumbent government; it has enabled Arce to rally public support, and shore up his image. ZÃºÃ±iga has also alleged Morales is planning to run for President despite a constitutionally-stipulated term limit and the latter has to be stopped.\nBolivia and other democratic nations heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday when the â€˜coupâ€™ came to an end, but socio-economic factors that have the potential to trigger an uprising and creating conditions for a real military intervention in the form of another coup remain in the Andean state, where public resentment is said to be palpable. Trouble is therefore far from over. Wednesdayâ€™s incident may be considered a foretaste of what is to come.\nAmbitious generals usually capitalise on public resentment and economic crises to project themselves as saviours and grab state power, as has been the experience of many countries in Latin America. They also do so at the instigation of foreign powers, the bloody overthrow of Salvador Allendeâ€™s democratically-elected, progressive government in Chile, one of Boliviaâ€™s neighbours, in 1973, being a case in point. The Bolivian Opposition and human rights groups have expressed fear that President Arce will use Wednesdayâ€™s incident to launch a campaign to suppress the Opposition. Arrests continue to be made, according to international media reports.\nAllâ€™s well that ends well, but it is hoped that the apparent coup in Bolivia will serve as a warning to all other nations which are facing similar political, social and economic problems, and that their leaders will refrain from provoking the public into staging uprisings and providing ambitious generals with opportunities to make forays into politics. The problem with political power is it is highly addictive like narcotics, and one who saviours it does not want to let go of it.','Editorial','2024-06-28','http://island.lk/a-coup-that-was-not/',NULL);

We note with utter dismay the detailed and sensationalised reporting of the said incident using CCTV coverage. The two children are easily identified in the clips shown. In trying to dramatise the incident, the rights of the children have been brutally violated and the basic principle of respecting the dead has been sadly and totally forgotten.\nChildren watching such incidents are known to be traumatised. We as Paediatricians, have had to help children who have presented with behaviour changes and psychosomatic symptoms following the exposure of these young minds to detailed traumatic experiences on TV and other forms of media in the past.\nFrequent and detailed reports of such acts can induce children to consider such incidents as â€œnormalâ€ behaviour in the young and undeveloped minds of individuals watching such reports. This is especially so in adolescents in whom impulse control is still immature. Adolescents are especially vulnerable to such influences and the tendency to imitate such behaviour is higher amongst them. For example, an association between sensationalised media reportage and subsequent increase in suicidal behaviour is well documented in the medical literature.\nIn addition, does the media have a right to disrespect the next of kin who are trying to grapple with a huge problem? Should their emotions and feelings not be considered? Two children from two families are dead. There are grieving parents, siblings, friends, teachers, etc. who are exposed to the details of the last few moments of the lives of these children on earth. What impact would this detailed reportage have on such individuals? Details of where the children lived are also being shown and highlighted. Such incidents of insensitive media reporting keep happening at regular intervals in the country. Media personnel should be more sensitive to such issues in future.\nWe implore you, as the Minister of Women and Child Affairs to look into this matter and take urgent remedial action for the future welfare of the children of our country.\nDr Kosala Karunaratne Dr Asvini D.

The estate labour lived on the estates, they had a little land and residence facilities. They incurred no transport cost getting to work. More than one person from each family worked on the estate.\nIt is also evident in recent yeas that a significant number of the younger generation are employed outside the estate sector in places like Colombo. For the plantations to retain the work force on the estates, some incentives, not necessarily wage increases, might be offered. Plantation companies should explore the feasibility of profit sharing schemes with labour granting workers a stronger stake for working on the estates and improving productivity.\nThe current plantation system originated with the takeover of British owned estates in the mid-1970s. Over 150,000 acres were bought from the British owners through a transparent negotiating process. The government and the owners agreed to a price of British pound 42.5 per acre (Rs. 1,125 at that time). This was a good deal for Sri Lanka.\nWhat was less appropriate were the management systems that followed. Regional Plantation Companies were established to overcome these deficiencies. Once again a new policy framework has to be created for the plantation companies to operate for at least the next 50 years. Policies should encourage long term investment on estates, re-planting programs, modernization of factories etc.\nThis new policy framework should be developed through a consultation process involving government, the companies and labour.\nI came across a book, â€œTropical Pioneers â€“ Human Agency and Ecological Change in the Highlands of Sri Lanka 1800-1900â€ by James L.A. Webb Jr., published by Oxford University Press in New Delhi in 2002. The author offers a fascinating story on the opening of, first coffee and then tea plantations, in Ceylon.\nThis volume is a valuable history of the opening of plantations in the 19th century and the methodical way the pioneers set about it.

As the news sank in, a video of our long association played in my mindâ€™s eye of our time together in medical school and the many years as a medic working in Kurunegala and North London. In all those years what stands out is his unassuming modesty, helpful kindness and unstinting generosity.\nTitus had his entire education at St Josephâ€™s College Colombo. I first met him when I entered the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Colombo in 1962. He was then a final year student and well into student politics vying for positions in the Medical Students Union.\nAfter he qualified Titus completed his internship at the General Hospital Kurunegala. Thereafter he continued to work in that hospital for several more years. He was then well known for his bohemian lifestyle. On an evening Titus was often found in the upper or lower club playing bridge and socialising with friends. He was the life and soul of the many parties held at the house officersâ€™ quarters in Kurunegala where the amber nectar flowed so freely. Titus soon became a well-known and well-respected member of the town. He was so much a part of the Kurunegala scene that when he was transferred to a post in Colombo he was sorely missed.\nIn those days Titus had a keen interest in Forensic Medicine and was appointed AJMO in Colombo. His hard work, diligence and expertise was soon recognised by the Department of Health and he was offered a scholarship for further training in London. Although Titus completed his training he wanted a change to his career. He paid the Dept of Health for his scholarship and decided to stay on in London as his elder son required specialist medical care. Titus soon established himself as a histopathologist and worked in several hospital in London and also in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nAlthough he decided to live in the UK, for reasons beyond his control, he had a lifelong love for the country of his birth. He bought a house in Colombo for his retirement and was a regular visitor to Sri Lanka. Titus always dreamed of returning home to his roots to end his days. He had an encyclopaedic knowledge of the history of the country and it was such a pleasure to discuss the past with him. Titus generously supported several Sri Lankan charities.\nWhen I arrived in the UK in the early 1970â€™s I contacted Titus. He very kindly found me a job in the hospital where he worked in North London. Titus became a helpful companion to the many young Lankan doctors who worked at that hospital. It was here I got to know Janaki, his wife, and his two sons Sudarshan and Ranil. Like most Lankans, Titus was an inveterate cricket fan. He also loved an occasional flutter on the horses. I recall with great joy his animated descriptions of those missed opportunities for a handsome win.\nHis generosity with his time and his indefatigable work ethic made him fun to work with. Titusâ€™ forthrightness and sense of duty stood out and was well liked by all. When the need arose, he could be tough and combative. Wherever he worked he established a formidable reputation as a strong and decisive leader. He never shrank away from speaking his mind and knew where to draw the line. The way we stuck together made us a happy team.\nHis political ideology was distinctly left-wing. He believed firmly in social equality and egalitarianism. Titus cared deeply for the poor and the needy. He was a relentless advocate for social justice. There was never a dull moment listening to him, even when you disagreed with some of what he said. He was an incredibly kind and considerate man.\nWe have been friends for many years. I will always remember his down-to-earth manner and his complete lack of pretension. What stands out is his honesty, unimpeachable integrity and the ability to take life in his stride despite the many sad events and tragedies he had to endure. Whenever we met or chatted on the phone we reminisced our time together. He always enquired about mutual friends. Such was the strength of feeling for his old friends. I remember Titus with much affection and respect.\nFor many years his own health has not been at its best. Titus dealt with these issues with enormous courage and characteristic indomitable spirit. He remained cheerful and his enthusiasm for life never waned. Despite his regular visits to hospital for dialysis whenever I phoned, he was upbeat and never complained. This wonderful attitude to adversity is a beacon to us all. I admire greatly the love and care given to Titus over so many years by Janaki and Ranil (who is a GP). This allowed Titus to lead a happy and near normal life for so long.\nA lifelong practical joker, his was a life well lived. He was well educated, well-travelled and enjoyed all the good things in life. Despite the years he never lost his sense of fun and adventure, and we remember most fondly his â€˜joie de vivreâ€™. We are comforted by the memory of his long, full and inspiring life and so proud of his devotion to helping others. To me personally, his demise is an end of an era.\nMay he attain the ultimate Bliss of Nirvana\nDr Nihal D Amerasekera ','Opinion','2024-07-06','http://island.lk/dr-titus-perera-a-life-remembered/',NULL),(7,_binary 'fŒKz*T‚Å˜','What is research?

R. Jayewardene. Inspired by Prof. Cyril Ponnamperuma and Prof. Chandra Wickramasinghe. Beginning, it was located in a small office in Colombo before evolving into a comprehensive research institute located in Kandy.\nProf. Chandra Wickramasinghe, a prominent Sri Lankan-born astrophysicist and mathematician affiliated with Cardiff University, UK, advocated for establishing a scientific research institution in Sri Lanka dedicated to fundamental science and global scientific advancement. He served as the founding Director of IFS. Similarly, Prof. Cyril Ponnamperuma, a renowned Sri Lankan-born scientist and astrobiologist at the University of Maryland, USA, devoted himself to establishing a research institute in Sri Lanka to foster scientific excellence and collaboration. His international reputation was instrumental in gaining support for IFS.\nThis article aims to highlight NIFSâ€™s broader contributions. Recognising the complexity of its history, a recent initiative under Senior Prof. Lakshman Dissanayakeâ€™s leadershipâ€”a 200-page coffee table bookâ€”documents NIFSâ€™s proud achievements comprehensively. This publication reflects NIFSâ€™s enduring legacy and its pivotal role in shaping scientific discourse in Sri Lanka and beyond.\nFundamental studies, also known as basic research, focus on exploring fundamental principles, theories, or concepts within a specific field. They aim to establish a solid understanding of underlying principles that form the basis of a discipline, often driven by curiosity.\nAdvanced studies, on the other hand, delve deeper into a field beyond foundational knowledge. While fundamental studies lay the groundwork, advanced studies build upon this foundation, though the terms can vary in usage and may not always be interchangeable.\nApplied research, distinct from both fundamental and advanced research, addresses practical problems or issues in real-world contexts, aims to generate solutions or improvements with immediate applicability, enhancing processes, products, or services and focuses on practical outcomes that directly benefit society or industry, distinguishing it from the theoretical focus of fundamental and advanced studies.\nOutcomes from research projects usually focus on contributing new knowledge to academic or scientific communities, often through publications in scholarly journals. In contrast, research programmes may lead to broader impacts, including policy changes, improvements in service delivery, or other tangible benefits for targeted populations or sectors.\nOne exemplary case illustrating these concepts is the evolution of the Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF) Project at the National Institute of Fundamental Studies (NIFS) in Sri Lanka. Initiated under the directorship of Prof. Ponnamperuma, the BNF Project commenced with the recruitment of Prof. S. A. Kulasooriya in 1983. During the initial years, as Prof. Ponnamperuma secured resources and transformed the Hantane Hotel into a research institute, the project faced challenges but persisted with support from the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA).\nInitially funded by a grant from the United Nations University, the BNF Project started laboratory studies with three research assistants who later pursued postgraduate studies abroad. After a brief hiatus, collaboration with the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, revitalised the project under Prof. Kulasooriyaâ€™s leadership, culminating in several local researchers earning postgraduate degrees. The collaboration concluded successfully in 1997.â€™\nDr. Gamini Seneviratneâ€™s entry marked a significant shift towards studying non-symbiotic microbial associations with plantsâ€”a more advanced research direction. His pioneering work identified biofilm formations among beneficial microbes, leading to the concept of biofilm-based biofertilizers (BFBF) introduced globally by NIFS in 2003. Subsequent research confirmed the efficacy of BFBFs in reducing chemical fertiliser usage while increasing crop yields, prompting patent acquisition and further studies on their agricultural applications.\nThe success of the BFBF research prompted the establishment of the Microbial Biotechnology Unit (MBU) at NIFS, consolidating ongoing projects under a unified framework. By 2009, field trials with the Tea Research Institute aimed to halve chemical fertiliser use, showcasing the practical impact of NIFSâ€™s research endeavors on sustainable agriculture.\nIn summary, the journey from the BNF Project to the MBU exemplifies how research projects can evolve into comprehensive programmes that address complex challenges through innovative scientific approaches. NIFSâ€™s contributions in microbial biotechnology highlight its pivotal role in advancing sustainable agriculture and fostering scientific excellence in Sri Lanka and beyond.\nâ€˜Samantha Kumarasinghe, a former science graduate from the University of Peradeniya, saw the potential of Biofilm-Biofertilizer (BFBF) technology and acquired its patent. He established Lanka Bio-Fertilizers (Private) Limited (LBF) to manufacture and distribute the fertiliser globally. Initially targeted for tea cultivation, the technology faced opposition from conventional agriculturists and institutes like the Tea Research Institute (TRI). Despite scepticism, field trials proved successful across various crops, leading to endorsements from the Department of Agriculture and TRI for rice and tea cultivation by 2017. Global scientists also recognised the innovation, developing similar biofilms and acknowledging NIFSâ€™s pioneering research.\nWhat is impact and impact pathways\nAccording to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) definition for The Research Excellence Framework (REF) is the new system for assessing the quality of research in UK higher education institutes; â€œImpact is defined as â€œan effect on, change or benefit to the economy, society, culture, public policy or services, health, the environment or quality of life, beyond academiaâ€.\nThe Microbial Biotechnology Unit (MBU) research as a classic case study to explain impact and impact pathways.\nThe research conducted by NIFS has significantly impacted both academic and non-academic sectors, particularly in Sri Lankaâ€™s agriculture:\nAcademic Impact: NIFS has advanced scientific understanding by emphasising the role of microorganisms in soil fertility, addressing a notable knowledge gap in Sri Lanka due to limited focus on soil microbiology within institutions like the Department of Agriculture. Training initiatives led by Professors Kulasooriya and Seneviratne at universities such as Peradeniya, Rajarata, and Wayamba have improved teaching on soil microbiology, focusing on topics like biological nitrogen fixation and microbial biofilms. This academic outreach has integrated concepts like BFBF into university curricula, broadening educational perspectives on sustainable crop production.\nThe programme has also trained numerous researchers, including Malkanthi Gunatilleke and Dr. Chandani Mudannayake, who have obtained postgraduate degrees and contributed to global research. Their work has fostered cross-disciplinary approaches, particularly in developing multi-microbial soil conditioners and Rhizobial Biofertilizers. These innovations have been recognised internationally, with Prof. Seneviratne listed among the top 2% scientists worldwide by Elsevier/Stanford.\nNon-Academic Impact: Commercialisation efforts, supported by patents and partnerships with industry, highlight significant economic impacts. Lanka Bio Fertilizers (Private) Limited has established production facilities and created jobs, demonstrating the viability of biofertilizers like BFBF in both local and export markets. These initiatives aim to reduce Sri Lankaâ€™s dependency on imported chemical fertilisers, potentially saving millions in foreign exchange annually.\nEnvironmental sustainability is another crucial outcome, with biofertilisers offering eco-friendly alternatives that mitigate environmental pollution associated with conventional agriculture. The acceptance of BFBF and Rhizobial Biofertilizers by policy makers underscores their role in sustainable agriculture, aligning with evidence-based policy-making initiatives. The Sectorial Oversight Committee on Food Security and Agriculture has recognised NIFSâ€™s leadership in ecofriendly agriculture, supporting national programmes in collaboration with agricultural authorities to promote these technologies among farmers.\nIn summary, NIFSâ€™s research has not only enriched academic discourse on soil microbiology but also catalysed practical advancements in agriculture, fostering economic resilience and environmental stewardship in Sri Lankaâ€™s farming communities.\nAttracting returns for R&D investment\nNIFS income from BFBF royalty significantly increasing over the last few years During 2022 and 2023 the NIFS has received 9 million rupees from sales of Rhizobium fertiliser. It has also received 24 million rupees as royalty from BFBF.\nChanging organisational cultures and practices\nThis detailed case study amply demonstrates that it is not a strange coincidence, that the National Institute for Fundamental Studies, had advanced from its â€œmandateâ€. Certainly, â€œitâ€™s not a retrograde step grossly deviating from its mandate and entertaining practical projects best carried out elsewhereâ€.\nFundamental research, advanced research and applied research leading to implementation research through multidisciplinary collaborations for impact finally brings benefits to the people beyond academia.\nIncreasing public engagement with research and related societal issues;\nletâ€™s return once again to the public engagement and involvement.\nEngaging the public and stakeholders at every stage of the research cycle is crucial. Social sciences play a pivotal role in this engagement, ensuring community involvement and support. Despite a historical exclusion, reinstating social sciences within IFS ACT has been a priority under my chairmanship. This approach includes organising farmer community events for awareness and support, integrating lived experiences into research design, and collaborating with stakeholders to co-produce research agendas.\nMoving forward, conducting studies using social science methods like focus groups and interviews will be essential. These efforts aim to address challenges and barriers, informing the development of an eco-friendly fertiliser policy for Sri Lanka, contingent on securing necessary funding.\nTherefore, we conclude, research for peopleâ€™s benefit is the moral story and such research is paramount for national development.','Opinion','2024-07-04','http://island.lk/what-is-research-why-do-research-and-for-whos-benefit/',NULL),(8,_binary 'fŒKz*T‚Å˜','Kinder government reaction to economic distress would evoke better public response','by Jehan Perera With less than a month before presidential elections are called, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has highlighted the success of his presidency as rescuing Sri Lanka from its international bankruptcy status that prevents it from doing business with the rest of the world.Â  Â The signing of the agreement on international debt restructuring for USD [&#8230;]','by Jehan Perera\n\nWith less than a month before presidential elections are called, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has highlighted the success of his presidency as rescuing Sri Lanka from its international bankruptcy status that prevents it from doing business with the rest of the world.Â  Â The signing of the agreement on international debt restructuring for USD 5.8 billion with the Official Creditor Committee consisting of several foreign governments that have given bilateral loans to Sri Lanka was celebrated in numerous ways.Â The president himself made a speech to the nation and firework exhibitions took place in various towns to mark the occasion.Â  The president made it clear that he was the architect of Sri Lankaâ€™s economic recovery.Â This puts upon him a greater responsibility to engage with the people, listen to them and explain to them what it all means.\nÂ President Wickremesinghe said, â€œI believed in my ability to save our country and its people from the economic abyss.

Furthermore, I had faith that with my planned policies and dedication, the economy could be revitalised.â€ The signing of the debt restructuring agreement received immediate plaudits from the countries that matter most to Sri Lanka at this time.Â  US Ambassador Julie Chung welcomed the news stating â€œThis is a positive step forward in Sri Lankaâ€™s economic recovery and resilience, helping build more confidence in Sri Lankaâ€™s fiscal environment. The US encourages Sri Lanka to continue the reform process, adopting transparent and sustainable changes that foster long-term prosperity and growth.â€Â  Similarly, Japan, India and the IMF also expressed their satisfaction with the progress that Sri Lanka was making.\nHowever, there was also a second agreement that Sri Lanka signed with Chinaâ€™s Exim Bank for USD 4.2 billion which has caused concern among the same parties that congratulated the President and the Sri Lankan negotiating team on reaching agreement with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) which did not include China.Â  They have demanded â€œcomparability of treatmentâ€ with other creditors, including China. In particular, they have requested details of Sri Lankaâ€™s other debt deals, and â€œall information necessary for the OCC to ensure comparability of treatmentâ€.Â  The details of the negotiations in both cases are not known, but will most probably be revealed as the parliamentary debate takes place this week.Â  This tension reflects the serious problem of lack of transparency in the governmentâ€™s financial transactions that runs across the board.\n\nNo Haircut\nPresident Wickremesinghe was cryptic when he said, â€œWith these agreements, we will be able to defer all bilateral loan instalment payments until 2028. Furthermore, we will have the opportunity to repay all the loans on concessional terms, with an extended period until 2043.â€ He did not say what these concessional terms were nor did he mention what the â€œhaircutâ€ would be.Â  While the amount that would be subject to concessional repayment is USD 5.8 billion the total foreign debt was in the region of USD 40 billion at the time of the economic collapse in 2022. Last year when the government was negotiating with the creditors there was optimism that a â€œhaircutâ€ in the range of 30 percent would be possible.Â  Specific to debt restructuring, a haircut is the reduction of outstanding interest payments or a portion of a bond payable that will not be repaid.\nAccording to research studies done by international researchers in the field, creditors offering debtors concessional terms in order to facilitate the repayment of loans taken is a common occurrence.Â  In this context, the international support given to the Sri Lankan government seems to be much less than was expected, or even what is fair.Â  A research study published last month in Germany states â€œWe study sovereign external debt crises over the past 200 years, with a focus on creditor losses, or â€œhaircutsâ€. Our sample covers 327 sovereign debt restructurings with external private creditors over 205 default spells since 1815. Creditor losses vary widely (from none to 100%), but the statistical distribution has remained remarkably stable over two centuries, with an average haircut of around 45 percent.â€ Graf von Luckner C.M. Meyer J. Reinhart C.M. Trebesch C., Publication Date, 06/2024,Â https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/sovereign-haircuts-200-years-of-creditor-losses-33019/Â  The expressions of international support would be more meaningful if they contribute to getting Sri Lanka much better terms for its debt restructuring.\nDue to the lack of information about the benefits to Sri Lanka of a reduction in the debt burden that would make an immediate impact on their lives, the presidentâ€™s victory speech did not gain much traction among the general public.Â  The public displays of celebratory fireworks in many parts of the country did not obtain any significant public participation. The fact is that the economic life of the people will not change either immediately or even in the short term, except marginally through changes in the controlled price of some commodities such as occurred with petrol. Those whose salaries have remained stagnant over the past two years have to cope with basic costs of living that have increased two to three-fold.Â Â  Unlike Kenya where mobs went on to the streets to protest against the increases in the cost of living and high taxes, the vast majority of Sri Lankan people have borne their difficulties in silence and in the privacy of their homes.\n\nStock Answer\nOrganised groups such as student unions and trade unions, however, are bringing the grievances of people out into the open.Â  The teachers protest which was ended by tear gas and water cannons fired upon them by the police was an example. Dr Ahilan Kadirgamar, who teaches economics at the University of Jaffna has written, in his Kuppi Talk column in The Island of 25 June)â€ â€œThe IMF-led austerity programme, despite many promises to preserve social spending, inevitably leads to cuts in the real value of social spending, as reflected in the recently released Finance Ministry Annual Report for 2023. Between 2021 and 2023 the cost of living in Sri Lanka increased by 100 percent, or if we look at it in dollar terms, the value of the Sri Lankan rupee declined by fifty percent from Rs 200 to Rs 300 per dollar. However, during this period the nominal spending increase for general education was only 22.5 percent and for higher education was a mere 13.1 percentâ€ as against the 100 percent inflation.\nIn simple terms, there is no money left in this depleted education budget for salary increases to be made, or for the government to even keep to the commitments it made to teachers in the past.Â  Dr Kadigamar further notes that â€œFor decades, Sri Lanka has been reducing its spending on education. In fact, expenditure on education has spiraled downwards over the decades from close to 5 percent of GDP in 1970 to 1.2 percent in 2022, one of the lowest today in the world.â€Â  The governmentâ€™s current approach to education, as spelled out by the president, is to hand it over to the private sector.Â  However, the withdrawal of the state from the provision of education services will be injurious to those from less well-off families in the context of the commercialisation of education as a profit making business and not a social service.Â  In a general context of grave economic hardship there is a need for more government investment in education for the economically disadvantaged and not less.\nTeachers came out onto the streets in their thousands to protest last week against the governmentâ€™s failure to address their concerns. There is no question that teachers are today a grossly underpaid sector though tasked with educating the younger generations to meet the challenges of the future. They were dispersed by the security forces with tear gas and water cannons. This harsh treatment of protestors has become the stock answer of the government to those who wish to make use of their democratic rights to question the government and to gather together to do so. It would be better if the president, as the key person behind the economic transformation of the country, were to talk to the protestors or at least to their leaders, hear them out and let them vent their grievances. When signing agreements that will bind the country for the future it is important for the government to take the people, and the opposition political parties, into its confidence and seek to obtain their support as well. This is the only way that solutions will last the test of time and be sustainable.\n\n','Opinion','2024-07-02','http://island.lk/kinder-government-reaction-to-economic-distress-would-evoke-better-public-response/',NULL),(9,_binary 'fŒK{*T‚Å˜','Short reply to President Ranilâ€™s public address','President used the TV channels to make a public address to the nation.

In the Oxford Dictionary it is defined as an â€œaction of forgiving or remission of the legal consequences of an offence or convictionâ€. Some argue that the power to grant a pardon is a check on the powers of the judiciary rectifying any miscarriage of justice. But this executive power unchecked could result in the abuse of power. \nIn recent times, President Sirisena granted two pardons â€“ one within six months and the other within nine days of relinquishing office while President Gotabay Rajapaksa granted two pardons â€“ one within four months of becoming president and the other seven months after he received a two thirds majority in Parliament.\nThe practice of giving Presidential pardons to political friends came to the limelight when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed a notorious Buddhist monk Ven. Galaboda Eththe Gnanasara who had received a pardon from President Sirisena earlier, as the Head of the Presidential Task Force to study and prepare a law to implement the concept â€œOne Country One Lawâ€, as though the monk was an epitome of righteousness.\nIn view of the controversial manner in which Presidents Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa had granted pardons, the proposals to tighten presidential prerogative in granting pardons was a strident demand during the course of the recent Aragalaya. However, the course of action provided in the 19th amendment for the Supreme Court to review pardons by way of Fundamental Rights applications, has become a positive feature in the hands of our independent Supreme Court which has maintained checks and balances on the executive power thereby preventing a culture of injustice undermining the Rule of Law.\nSome murders highlight brutality and arrogance of the accused when committing crimes. Such acts bring immense agony, pain and suffering to the victims and their loved ones. That is why a president is expected to intervene with utmost care when using his prerogative to grant a pardon. In doing so, he is obliged to consider the gravity of the offence, the role of the police in containing crime, the specific role of the AGs department and the judiciary in imparting justice and not be arbitrary, unreasonable and ignore the public interest.\nIn Britain, the courts have jurisdiction to review the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of the Monarch to grant a pardon â€œin accordance with accepted public Law principlesâ€. In India too, the Indian Supreme Court has held that in a landmark judgement in Epuru Sudhakar and Another vs Government of Andhra Pradesh , that the Indian Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to review presidential pardons.\nThe request for a pardon is generally forwarded by the Prisons Department based on good behaviour, age and medical condition etc. Of the prisoner. Therefore it plays a leading role in deciding on a convictâ€™s life in prison. Also, the prisoner himself can appeal for a pardon. \nArticle 34 (1) of the Constitution, while stating that the President may in the case of any offender convicted by any court (a) grant a pardon either free or subject to lawful conditions, (b) grant any respite for an indefinite period, of the execution of any sentence, (c) substitute a less severe form of punishment imposed on the offender or (d) remit the whole or any part of the punishment imposed, has incorporated a Proviso to the Article 34 which states that : â€˜where the offender has been condemned to death, the President shall call for the report from the Judge who tried him and shall forward that report for AGâ€™s advice and thereafter the President shall submit all to the Minister of Justice, who shall forward the report with his recommendations to the President.â€™ \nPresidential pardons for offenses not amounting to murder\nPresidential pardons are a regular feature in cases where prisoners are convicted of minor offences. Such pardons are granted marking special events like Vesak, Christmas and Independence Day. In such cases of non-murder offences, pardons are given mainly during national festivals. According to statistics available in the Ministry of Justice, Presidents J R Jayewardene, R Premadasa, D B Wijetunga released 72 convicts during 1978 to 1994. The first President J R Jayewardene pardoned gangster Gonawela Sunil in 1983 convicted for raping a 14-year-old girl in 1982. On that occasion, The President of the BASL, A C (Bunty) de Zoysa protested strongly. Zoysa was a working Committee member of the UNP at the time but had the guts to clash with his party leader. However, his protests were ignored.\nThis rapist gangster is alleged to have executed a plan to massacre 53 Tamil Prisoners in 1983. ( N Jordan, Retd Deputy Prisons Chief- CDN, 16 Nov. 1999 ). President Premadasa pardoned Manori Daniels, a teacher in a government school in the Batticaloa District and a mother of two, who was convicted of aiding and abetting the LTTE bomber Gagendran who caused the death of 40 civilians in a car bomb blast in Maradana, on November 9. 1987. She was given a six year sentence in October 1989. (President Premadasa expected the LTTE to reciprocate his goodwill. But as history has recorded, LTTE never reciprocated gestures of goodwill shown by either Presidents Ranasinghe Premadasa or subsequently Mahinda Rajapaksa).\nPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa pardoned 10 former members of the Presidential Security Division ( PSD ) who were sentenced for over four years after they were found guilty of assaulting and causing bodily harm to a famous husband wife duo because they sang at an opposition political party musical show.\nPresidential pardons where death sentences are pronounced\nIn murder convictions, the presiding judge always files a report. This report is available to the President and to the Committee sitting on the future of such convicts. If a presidential pardon is granted to a murder convict in death row, in most instances the death sentence is reduced to life imprisonment.\nâ€œLife sentenceâ€ means 20 years. From time to time, the term gets reduced due to good behaviour, age, medical condition etc. Finally, the prisoner is sent home before the reduced term is reached but under a supervisory licence and required to be of good behaviour.\nDuring President Chandrika Kumaratungaâ€™s presidency, a policy was formulated and is being followed today where a committee comprising of a retired judge as chairman, an official from the AGâ€™s and Prisons Departments, Ministry of Justice and a psychologist sit in committee to decide on the future of a prisoner on whom a death sentence is passed. The committee decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.\nAbuse of presidential power\nBut with time, unchecked presidential power began to corrupt, resulting in abuse of power. It expanded to instances where murderers were pardoned with impunity.\nIn the first of such cases was President Mahinda Rajapaks  pardoning in March 2009, Mary Juliet Monica Fernando (a ministerâ€™s wife) convicted of a double murder in 2005. In view of the controversies surrounding the impunity with which President Mahinda Rajapaksa used his Executive powers in general, the Yahapalanaya government enacted the 19th amendment, in which provision was made for the Supreme Court jurisdiction to review the official decisions of a President by way of a Fundamental Rights application under Article 35 (1) of the Constitution. As a result, a way to check presidential excesses was made available to the people, thereby upholding the doctrine of â€œSeparation of Powersâ€ in the Constitution.\nDespite the enactment of the said 19th Amendment by his own government, President Sirisena granted pardons to: (1) controversial Buddhist monk and Secretary General of the militant Bodu Bala Sena in May 2019. He had been sentenced to six years for contempt of court after failing in his appeal to the Court of Appeal in August 2019. This pardon was granted a mere six months before Sirisena relinquished office.\n(2) to Jude Anthony Jayamaha on November 9, 2019, a mere nine days before he relinquished office despite the Supreme Court having dismissed Jayamahâ€™s appeal confirming the death sentence. \nIn the face of severe criticism, a press release from the presidentâ€™s office on November 11, 2019 stated that Ven Athuraliya Rathana Thero moved in the matter in writing and made verbal representation with Ven Baddegama Samitha Thero, Ven Karandawela Punnaratana Thero, Ven Balangoda Buddhagosha Thero and Catholic Bishop Raymond Wickramasinghe. They appealed to the President to pardon Jayamaha. Many allegations were made about large sums of money being paid to various persons for the services rendered but, astonishingly no formal inquiry was made to find out the truth about these allegations made by the presidentâ€™s media division, although some of those named were MPs.\nAggrieved by the presidential pardon, a F R application was filed by â€˜The Women and Media Collectiveâ€™ challenging the use of the presidentâ€™s constitutional power to grant a pardon as he does not have the freedom to grossly violate the Rule of Law, equity and rationality and has no right to recklessly disregard the sensitivities and sensibilities of the aggrieved family from whom a young life was taken away in a gruesome murder. When the case was taken for hearing, the court was informed by the Controller of Immigration and Emigration that after Jayamaha was granted the pardon, he had travelled overseas and is not to be found. The SC ordered overseas travel ban until further consideration.\nA three-member Bench delivering the judgement found President Sirisena had intentionally violated the constitution and ordered him to pay Rs 1 m each to the parents of the victim and Rs 1 m to the petitioner and directed the AG to take tangible measures to secure the custody of the Jayamaha.\nDespite mud in the face of the outgoing President Sirisena, the newly elected President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, also misused his constitutional privilege. Armed with a massive 6.9m voter mandate, he gave two pardons: (1) to an Army Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake on March 26, 2020 â€“ a mere four  months after he assumed office despite a five Judge Bench of the Supreme Court affirming on April 25, 2019 the death sentence and (2) to former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva on June 24, 2021- a mere seven months after receiving a two thirds majority in Parliament.\nIt is heartening to observe that the Supreme Court has asserted its authority by judicially checking the presidential prerogative to grant pardons. It has already issued an interim order, nullifying the presidential pardon granted to Duminda Silva and fixed September 4 to hear the FR case challenging the pardon given to former soldier Sunil Ratnayake.\nIn the case of Duminda Silva, The Colombo High Court imprisoned this controversial parliamentarian for life in 2016 over the murder of MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed a highly controversial Presidential Commission to investigate incidents of political victimization which recommended the release of Duminda Silva. The President promptly granted a special pardon to Duminda Silva in June 2021. But in May 2022, the SC issued an interim order directing the CID to place Duminda Silva under prison custody and impound his passport.\nOne of the most obnoxious and controversial acts of President Gotabaya Rajapakse was to grant Lance Corporal Suni Ratnayake a pardon for the murder of eight Tamil civilians in December 2000. This act of the president after the war victory and at a time the country required reconciliation to rebuild the countryâ€™s economy after a 30 year war and reconcile and integrate the Tamil community was not expected of a Head of a State and was a stab in the back of reconciliation.\nFortunately, The SC has granted leave to appeal in five FR cases filed by the family members of the victims and the Centre for Policy Alternatives, challenging the former Presidentâ€™s decision to pardon former soldier and directed service of notices on the former president and Ratnayake to be present at the hearing in September 2024, as both were unrepresented in court.\nThe people should recall the facts of this heinous crime and the court verdict, to understand the gravity of the crime committed on so many innocent lives. Lance Corporal Sunil Ratnayake, with a 20 strong military unit of the Gajaba Regiment was airlifed to Mirusavil, Jaffna, on December 18, 2000. The murder of eight villagers took place just one day later on December 19, 2000.\nHe was sentenced to death by a High Court Trial at Bar in June 2015 after almost 15 months since the date of the crime. A five judge Bench sitting in appeal in the Supreme Court affirmed the sentence on April 25, 2019. The court held that the prosecution had established all eight counts of murder (11-18) and count of causing hurt to Maheswaran ( 19 ) and confirmed the death sentence.\nBriefly the facts are as follows: When the fighting intensified in 2000 and the LTTE overran Elephant Pass in April 2000, the army retreated to Ellathumaduwal and the villagers dispersed from their village Mirusavil to close by villages due to stray shells falling nearby. But the villagers developed the habit of visiting their homes in Mirusavil to clean their houses and collect whatever produce they can and return before dusk.\nOn December 18, 2000, a military unit of the Gajaba Regiment was airlifted to Mirusavil. On December 19, eight villagers comprising a five-year-old toddler accompanying his father, two 13- and 15-year-old boys accompanying their fathers visited their homes on cycles, as villagers used to do.\nOn this fateful day at about 4 pm, when the eight villagers were getting ready to return with whatever produce they had collected, the five-year-old had pestered the father to pluck a guava fruit from a nearby tree. The father not having the heart to disappoint his son, had with the others on their cycles, gone towards the fruit tree. But they were confronted on the way by two soldiers â€“ one with a firearm and the other with a knife. After an initial questioning, one soldier went back and returned with four other military men who together had severely assaulted all the men with blunt weapons. When witness Maheswaran (only surviving witness) regained consciousness, they blindfolded him with his sarong and threw him over a fence. His sarong was entangled on the fence and he lay injured in his underwear.\nSubsequent events narrated by Maheswaran, disclosed how he escaped not knowing the fate of the others and met his father who was searching for him. His mother to whom the story was related, had complained to the political office of the EPDP. Subsequently he was admitted to the Chandigar hospital. On information and pressure, the army authorities promptly started investigating the incident.\nDuring the search of the area by the Military Police with Maheswaran, a few soldiers accompanied by Officer Commanding the unit Sgt Ranasinghe stationed about 50 meters away from the scene of the crime, had approached the search party. Seeing them Maheswaran had spontaneously cried out pointing at two soldiers as the two who had severely beaten them up. They were Lance Corporal Ratnayake and Private Kumarasinghe.\nSubsequently at a Magisterial inquiry, five persons were identified among whom were the first accused appellant Ratnayake and Kumarasinghe. On court orders, a search revealed the bodies and the bicycles of all the eight unfortunate civilians killed and buried at a spot shown by Ratnayake â€“ the accused appellant. The relatives had identified the bodies.\nThey were charged for unlawful assembly and murder and causing hurt to the only eyewitness Maheswaran and deceased Raviwarnam.\nThe entire case was based on circumstantial evidence and lay on the credibility of the evidence of the only eye witness, Maheswaran. The court had observed that the witness was traumatized and had even refused to go with the army to identify places if not accompanied by EPDP and ICRC officials.\nMedical evidence confirmed the assault to be compatible with Maheswaranâ€™s testimony. The doctor who did the post mortem examination stated that all bodies had injuries by assault and cut injuries around the back of either side of the neck, which severed the two main arteries and were necessarily fatal. The prosecution had contended that no firearms were used in murdering, as the killers were aware of the war situation in the area and took precautions not to make a noise by firing.\nThe defence argued that Maheswaranâ€™s evidence had contradictions and omissions. But both courts held that they were all minor and insignificant. The SC further observed that the witness was a Tamil with no knowledge of Sinhala. His evidence was translated into Sinhala writing and some discrepancies may have occurred.\nThe SC commented that in his dock statement the accused appellant had admitted that he was present in the area on this fateful day. The SC having considered the totality of all the evidence, circumstantial and otherwise, came to the conclusion that: (1) there was irresistible inference that it was appellant and his group of men that had inflicted the fatal injuries to all deceased and (2) from the nature of injuries, it was safe to conclude that the injuries were inflicted with an intention to cause death.\nIt is hoped that the agitation launched by civil society will succeed and ensure that the process of granting a pardon by the Head of State will be strengthened by unambiguous constitutional and legal provisions, so that such a privilege is retained but not abused for collateral reasons.','Politics','2024-07-06','http://island.lk/presidential-pardons-an-unchecked-executive-power/',NULL),(1,_binary 'fŒLE*T‚Å˜\Z','S.W.R.D Bandaranaike â€“ (1899- 1959): laid low by six bullets from an assassinâ€™s weapon','(Excerpted from Selected Journalism by HAJ Hulugalle) Sir Solomon Dias Bandaranaike who was Maha Mudaliyar or Chief Interpreter to the Governor was born on May 22, 1862.

Sir Solomon acted as extra A.D.C. to His Majesty King George V of England during the latterâ€™s visit to Ceylon as Duke of York in 1901. He was well known in sporting circles and a proprietary planter.\nProfessor S A Pakeman of the Ceylon university wrote of the son: â€œBandaranaike was a clever young man, the only son of Sir Solomon Dias Bandaranaike, the Maha Mudaliyar, head of the leading upper-class family in the low-country. The Maha Mudaliyar was, technically, the â€˜chief native interpreterâ€™, a ceremonial position of great dignity. In this capacity he was closely connected for formal and ceremonial purposes with the Governors, and named his son `West Ridgewayâ€™ after one of them.\nâ€œHe was in fact a land owner on a large scale. His autobiography, Remembered Yesterdays, throws much light on the life and ways of thinking of his class. He was a man highly respected by people of all races.\nâ€œHe sent his son to Christ Church College, Oxford, where he read Western classics and became Junior Treasurer of the Oxford Union, having a natural gift for speaking.\nâ€œOn his return to Ceylon he entered municipal politics and then national politics. The way he was brought up meant that he had little acquaintance with the Sinhalese language but he made himself fluent in that tongue, though he admitted later that he could neither read nor write the script with any ease.\nâ€œHis point of view differed completely from that of his father, and he became an enthusiastic nationalist, with emphasis on Sinhalese primacy.â€\nDr. Howard Wriggins, a Professor from Princeton in the United States in his book Ceylon: Dilemma of a Nation, with less first-hand knowledge and depth of understanding wrote: â€œOne fundamental rift within the UNP sprang from the problem of succession. When the Sinhala Maha Sabha was brought into the UNP, it was generally understood that Mr. Bandaranaike as second of the largest component of the UNP would succeed Mr. D. S. Senanayake who was expected to step down from the party leadership in the near future.\nâ€œBut Mr. Senanayake did not step down. It became clear as time went on that Mr. Senanayake was not sure that the post should be reserved for Mr. Bandaranaike. On the contrary, it became clear that he was grooming his nephew, Major John Kotalawala, for the post instead. These manoeuvres were explicable as part of a long-standing competition between the Senanayake and Bandaranaike family clans.â€\nDr. Wriggins continues that â€œthere was little trust and confidence between them. Hence when the United National Party was formed, with Mr. D. S. Senanayake as the dominant figure, it was not surprising to those who knew the family background of these men that Mr. Bandaranaike should have been unwilling to subordinate himself to the elder Senanayake.\nâ€œOn the other hand, Mr. Bandaranaike and others came to feel that the elder Senanayake did not trust Mr. Bandaranaike. It appeared that Mr. D. S. Senanayake kept foreign policy matters to himself, a circumstance already formalized in the Constitution in which the portfolio of External Affairs was merged with the office of the Prime Minister. With this interpretation in mind, it was not surprising that the Sinhala Maha Sabha, the creation of Bandaranaike, was not dissolved; nor was his resignation from the Cabinet in 1951 unexpected.â€\nBandaranaike himself did not wish to separate the Ministry of External Affairs from that of the Prime Minister in 1956. Wriggins says in successive pages that â€œit became evident that he (Senanayake) was grooming his nephewâ€ and that he â€œbegan to build up his son.â€ In fact his son was not interested in the post and, as Wriggins himself says, â€œfinally accepted with reluctance and after much indecision.â€\nIt would do less than justice to the memory of Senanayake and Bandaranaike to say that the break between the two leaders in 1951 was solely or largely due to family rivalries. They were both men of stature, devoted to the interests of the country but their background, make-up, intellectual processes and philosophy were different.\nBandaranaike was a remarkable speaker, apt to be carried away by the exuberance of his oratory, but he was skillful in drawing fine distinctions as when, after his resignation, it came to defining his position between the United National Party and the Marxists, both Trotskyites and Leninists, with whom he was ready to make electoral pacts to dethrone the UNP. As for Senanayake, although social reform and economic development were his aims, he was not known to have used the word â€˜socialismâ€™ and could not quite make out what Ceylonese speakers meant when they advocated â€˜socialism.â€™\nHulugalle with Mr and Mrs Bandaranaike\nThe respective contributions of Senanayake and Bandaranaike to the modern history of Ceylon were, in a sense, complementary. The older man won independence for Ceylon, gave the country stable government and a viable administrative machine and identified agriculture, especially food production, as the principal target of Ceylonâ€™s economic development.\nIf anybody seeks a monument to Senanayakeâ€™s work in the sphere of agriculture he has only to look round and see the irrigation works he constructed and the hundreds and thousands of acres of new land he helped to bring under cultivation in the sparsely populated areas of Ceylon. He appreciated British political traditions and sought the friendship of the people of Great Britain and of the Dominions. He was a practical man, patient, clear-sighted, friendly and prone to estimate any project solely by its practical bearing on the interests of the common people in Ceylon.\nAdmirers have compared Senanayake and Bandaranaike with Patel and Nehru in India. Bandaranaike had Nehruâ€™s educational background, the same western culture, the power of speech and egalitarian perspectives, a sheltered life before plunging into the political maelstrom and a vague vision of the future. Senanayake on the other hand, was like Patel, a man of action, with a deep knowledge of human nature and human weakness and a vision deeply grounded on the hard facts of life.\nThough repeatedly he disclaimed Marxist doctrines, Bandaranaikeâ€™s politics were radical and had socialist overtones. He set out to build a new society which suited the genius of the Ceylonese people in the context of a changing world. To do this he had to take note of the new political status of the country.\nIn a speech shortly after his resignation, Bandaranaike said: â€œBut how did freedom come? It came not after a fight upon definite principles. policies and programmes, but it really came in the normal course of events, that is, attempts to persuade Commissions sent from England to grant this little bit or that little bit extra; and finally, in the wake of freedom that was granted to countries like India, Pakistan and Burma. Our Soulbury Constitution was altered to extend to us the same type of Dominion Status. There was no fight for that freedom which involved a fight for principles, polices and programmes which could not be carried out unless that freedom was obtained. No. It just came overnight. We just woke up one day and we were told, â€˜You are a Dominion now.\nâ€œWhat was the psychological effect that was created, particularly among those who in the previous 15 or 20 years had been working the other Constitution, who came into the free Parliament, many of whom became Ministers of this free Constitution? The psychological effect was to go along the same road. That was quite understandable. It did not involve any dishonesty or some deliberate wrong-doing on the part of any individual. That was the natural way one thought in those circumstances.\nâ€œIt is quite easy, for instance if, after the Englishman has made a road, when he is driving his car along the road, he suddenly stops and says, â€˜Well, look here my dear fellow, I am getting off this driving seat; you can sit there; I shall sit behind, for the driver to continue along the same road with the same thinking and acting in the same way.\nâ€œWe are thinking on different planes, probably all of us bona fide. While one set of people were thinking on that line, another set were thinking quite differently. I, for instance, was thinking that freedom meant something much more than that, particularly that in the context of world affairs today this free country, with great difficulty and trouble, had to cut a new free road through the forest and to make its own vehicle travel along that final goal of prosperity and happiness which every free country has the right to expect. That was the psychology out of which this situation has arisen.â€\nBandaranaike went on to say that the backbone of the Government from which he had resigned was â€œthe reactionary capitalistic elementsâ€ and that â€œa tendency in the Cabinet system towards a form of dictatorship seems to have unquestionably developed.â€\nBandaranaike was already mobilizing the various elements in the country dissatisfied with Senanayakeâ€™s domination of the Government and of Parliament. The argument that the UNP was supported mainly by reactionary capitalistic elements was a useful card to play when the poor were in a majority and had the power of the vote to overturn any Government. Bandaranaike foresaw that, in a developing country with a fast-growing population under a system of adult franchise, political power must necessarily pass to the masses.\nâ€œHis own political future, as he saw it, depended on his ability to give leadership to the new generations of voters. In a speech made in the House of Representatives on July 30, 1952, he said: â€œThe feudal system itself gave way and broadened out into what we understand as capitalist democracy. The small ruling feudal class broadened out into a plutocratic governing class, which was still large. The capitalist democracy is a thing that is dying hard. It has been dying since 1940. It is dying still â€“ not quite dead yet.\nâ€œWhen you say that this is the age of the common man â€“ a phrase I think was first used by Henry Wallace in the United States of America â€“ that power is widening out into the hands of the people. I, who believe in democracy, would term it in this way: that capitalistic democracy is widening out into a peopleâ€™s democracy. I am not using the word â€˜democracyâ€™ in a certain totalitarian sense that may be used by certain others. I am using the word â€˜democracyâ€™ in the true sense of the word and the entire emphasis today must be on the needs of the people. That is the position â€“ the international position â€“ of changes that are taking place, and in that context we obtained a large measure of political independence.\nâ€œThe task, therefore, that faced us was two-fold: to convert socially, culturally, economically and administratively a colonial system into a free system and also to do it in a manner calculated to give effect to the second need of changing world conditions when the true needs of the people were attended to as a primary condition.â€\nBandaranaike built his strength on a rural basis. Sinhala as the official language, a special position for Buddhism as the religion of the majority, the delegation of power to village councils and the magic word â€˜socialismâ€™ were the most effective weapons in his armoury. He was the most articulate politician of his time and found little difficulty in getting his message across. He drew into his fold the village school teacher, the ayurvedic (indigenous) medical practitioner and the ambitious and capable young politician who would otherwise have had to be content with a modest post as a Government clerk. The General Election of 1956 proved that his efforts had not been in vain and the successes of the political party he created after he had himself departed from the scene show that he had read the signs correctly and acted shrewdly and with prescience.\nBandaranaike was a master of retort. Once when a Communist leader in the State Council had attacked him and when the same member pretended to be asleep, when it was Bandaranaikeâ€™s turn to counter-attack, he turned to an interrupter and said â€œLet sleeping dogs lie!â€ On another occasion Dr. N. M. Peres the Trotskyite leader, during the Budget debate said that Bandaranaike could not help being merely the â€œfamous son of a famous father.â€ The merciless retort by Bandaranaike alluded to his opponent as the â€œobscure son of a still more obscure father.â€\nSix bullets from an assassinâ€™s weapon laid him low.\n','Politics','2024-07-06','http://island.lk/s-w-r-d-bandaranaike-1899-1959-laid-low-by-six-bullets-from-an-assassins-weapon/','http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SI-P06-07-07-PDC-3.jpg'),(2,_binary 'fŒLF*T‚Å˜','Ships,Â vel palamÂ and other concerns','President Ranil Wickremasinghe got a bellyful of criticism in the print media last Sunday â€“ June 30.

Â Why? His Address to the Nation which he named Good News and believed would descend, Cass is certain, like manna on an adoring public; consolation and salvation brought unto them singly and solely by him throughout-negotiating the IMF as he outdid the bankruptcy of the country. True, if bankruptcy is solely measured by queues for gasoline products.\nHe did accept the challenge when the House of the Rajapaksas was in a shambles with the PM Mahinda R, slinking home after being made to shed his premiership; and President Gotabaya fleeing overseas, shorn of his presidency, leaving the country headless. Sajith and his team made unfulfillable demands to steer the country forwards; he was cowardly. Ranil accepted the challenge, working with the Pohottu Cabinet.\nHe succeeded to a large measure in steadying the country but definitely not all by himself and not really satisfactorily. He is widely accused of shielding the corrupt and allowing corruption to continue like receiving commissions and handouts. The culmination of his appeasing greed in others, in his greed to continue as Prez, will be if he permits luxury car licenses to the present MPs and gives in to their demand for insurance for life in addition to the pensions for life, they get from serving just one term in Parliament.\nCass speaks as a householder. Her burdens have increased. Her domestic expenses have not decreased much. The meager interest earned from depositing her stringently saved earnings when she was employed is taxed; having a meal in a restaurant is now an unrealised dream since a heavy tax has to be paid. More people have fallen below the poverty line.\nMalnutrition is on the rise and the education and health sectors are not at all what they should be. Past leaders lived it up and we have to pay; they borrowed heavily and built useless vanity structures and we have to pay. We the poor bear so much of the expenses of the state, which state they crashed. And they live carefree in comfort.\nTo come back to the broadcast to the Nation by the President, his good news was that the country is now on an economic even keel and repayment of taxes is off our shoulders for a long time. We are far from economically all right and repayment of borrowed money has to be done, though temporarily debtor countries have given us grace periods.\nThe analogies, similes, metaphors, comparisons were what took Cassâ€™ goat as the saying goes. She was astounded and then giggled uncontrollably. Ranil equated himself to Grusha of theÂ Caucasian Chalk Circle. Bertolt Brecht had Grusha, the maid in the Governorâ€™s mansion save the deserted Governorâ€™s child and carry it to safety and then when the Governorâ€™s wife claimed the child as hers, Azdak the Judge, very wisely decreed the child belonged to Grusha, who had proved herself a genuine mother.\nAnd so Ranil Wickremasinghe himself decreed that he carried deserted, bereft Sri Lanka to a safe economic state and thus (though unsaid in so many words) should be rewarded with getting Sri Lanka as his: continued protectorÂ alias its next Prez. Quite an analogy included in his Address to the Nation, said before too, and later in his address to Parliament on 02 July.\nAnother analogy cropped up at a recent political meeting of a motley collection of members of different political parties with Harin Fernando leading the bandwagon. He said that Ranil Wicks, wisely, adroitly, most cleverly, and with remarkable seamanship (economic knowhow) steered the ship â€“ Sri Lanka â€“ to safe waters, a haven where all people can now breathe free and be happy, their economic and other burdens lifted. Listening, Cass spat out: What nonsense!\nThen, when it came to the one being lauded and launched (as likely Prez), Ranil made his speech of acceptance of being lauded and launched by upgrading the ship he steered to safety as the Titanic! He was successful in steering it to a safe haven (even if it is to pretend economic recovery) unlike Captain Edward J Smith, who had his Titanic sink to the bottom of the ocean on April 14, 1912.\nYou have to admit that Wickremesinghe did bring sanity into government madness, a kind of stability to the situation in Sri Lanka; got the economy going and influenced the IMF and funders to help the country. But definitely not single-handedly. So many helped.\nRanil W is not safe and settled.Â  He has not in plain Sinhala announced he is contesting the to-be presidential election? Not in English nor Tamil either. However he has been strongly hinting so and Harin Fernando and others who bawled out at the meeting on June 29 indicated definitely it was a launching of candidature event.\nNow Cassandra comes into her own; meaning she is able to make prophetic pronouncements like her Trojan ancestor who shouted â€˜I see bloodâ€™ and soon enough her abductor/patron/keeper, King Agamemnon, was dead â€“ murdered by his queenâ€™s lover. Present day Cassâ€™ warning is to Wickremesinghe. She says: â€œSome of the politicians seen at the Harin Fdo meeting which means they are in your camp are sure too heavy ballast to carry on your ship as you secure it.\nThe ship will sink even in shallow water with such on board.â€ Another warning: â€œRemember Winston Churchill lost the parliamentary election of 1945 soon after the victory of the Allies of which Britain was a partner in WWII. More than your achievement, RW, he was instrumental in winning a world war that raged for five years and Britain was almost invaded by the Nazis.â€ So, beware whom you take on board. You worked with a Cabinet including some dubious characters, or should it be said â€˜mostâ€™? Now donâ€™t have those who are known for thuggery and thieving.\nThe Sea around Sri Lanka\nCass joins in mourning the death of a Navy person who was shot and killed by Indian fishermen illegally fishing in Sri Lankan waters. Priyanka Ratnayake, aged 40 and father of two, lost his life in service. He was said to be a competent swimmer and diver and a man well-spoken of. This focuses very necessary attention on fishersâ€™ poaching, of which thieving act South Indians seem to outdo very much our own. A solution must be negotiated. Easier said than done, but another clichÃ© is apt here: If there is a will, there is a way.\nFour deep sea fishermen have died because of their greed, stupidity and the common factor of anything free is fair fare. Sri Lankans are notoriously known to accept even a headache if free. A bottle floating in the high seas is dragged or fished in and contents consumed. These men surely had to be already inebriated on drink or drugs to swig off a bobbing bottle. Did they not fear it could contain a spirit caught and bottled and flung into the sea as is done by ourÂ kattadiyas?\nLast bit of sea news.Â A seascape of mountains fairly distant from the south of the island but within its territorial waters has attracted commercial attention. Believed to be rich in cobalt it is to be exploited. And who is a forerunner businessman wanting to lay his hands on this treasure â€“ Gautam Shantilal Adani, great friend of PM Modi and exploiter of our land. Cannot we keep the cobalt to ourselves or is it to be sold cheap to fill a couple of rogue pockets, as is usual in this land like no other?','Politics','2024-07-04','http://island.lk/ships-vel-palam-and-other-concerns/','http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/cassandracry.jpg'),(3,_binary 'fŒLF*T‚Å˜','Politics and the Plantation Wage','by Anura Gunasekera President Ranil Wickremesinghe chose the Ceylon Workersâ€™ Congress May Day platform, in Kotagala, to announce the increase of the plantation workersâ€™ daily wage to Rs 1,700.00.

An unexpected presidential fiat, delivered just a few months before a possible election by a potential presidential candidate, was made public from the political platform of a major plantation trade union, generally seen as pro-government. The self-evident political implications do not merit either debate or elaboration.\nPreamble\nIn a rational world, in any industry, the employer and the employee should arrive at a fair wage through a consultative process. The unsolicited intervention of a third force with an agenda unrelated to the interests of either party, is undesirable from all points of view. Still, there are precedents, when sitting presidents have mandated wage increases in the plantation sector, for patently political reasons, ignoring the possible toxic economic consequences.\nAbrupt and illogically high increases are self-defeating, as sudden, unmanageable cost inflation force enterprises to withhold or diminish essential inputs, deny upgrades, abandon new investment and, in extreme cases, even close down. Unviable enterprises cannot discharge responsibilities to society, stakeholders, the economy and the environment. When operational costs suddenly exceed revenue the only relief is a magical increase in the selling price. Bur miracles do not happen in the real commercial world.\nProducts prices at public auctions are determined by unpredictable local and international market dynamics of supply and demand. Hence, the producer needs to be able to operate within a framework of reasonably priced inputs, especially the workerâ€™s daily wage, which, prior to the above increase, constituted around 65% of the unit production cost; that could well be the largest labour cost component in the unit production cost of any factory produced item, in any industry, anywhere in the world.\nEstimates are that the increase of the plantation wage to Rs 1,700.00 (with EPF/ETF- LKR 1.955.00 per day) will raise the above component to about 75% of the unit cost of production. The balance input proportion, representing fertilizer, energy, chemicals, other material requirements, machinery, vehicle and building maintenance, and welfare and contingencies, offers minimal margin for cost management. With that kind of lop-sided production cost distribution, no legitimate industry can remain viable.\nMarket Realities\nTrade unionists who seek wage increases linked directly to auction price fluctuations, and politicians who support such proposals when it suits personal political aspirations, ignore the realities of international trends of supply and demand. Wage increases, whilst being of crucial importance, especially in periods of rapid cost-of-living inflation, still need to be sustainable in the context of the relevant industry .\nAn analysis of world market prices of Tea and Rubber in the last three decades, will demonstrate a consistent pattern of long troughs relieved by sudden, short-lived peaks. These trends are directly linked to weather, climate, production levels, changes in consumption patterns, resultant supply and demand, exchange rate movements , inflationary or recessive trends in consuming economies, and political climate and state-imposed trade policies and tariffs.\nIn the case of Rubber, in addition to all of the above, speculation in futures markets, crude oil prices, innovations in synthetic alternatives and fluctuating demand in high consumption industries, such as tyre and vehicle manufacture, are key determinants in demand and price. These factors contribute to a permanent state of commodity-market volatility. They also converge to fashion â€œGlobal Economic Healthâ€, which determines the buying and selling price of all internationally traded commodities.\nAll of the above is to demonstrate that, whilst accepting the imperative of a living wage for the plantation worker, that it is unrealistic and imprudent to determine a wage increase, based on industry revenues during periods of peak prices.\nImpact Distribution\nThe mandated increase will impact tea, rubber and oil palm plantations in the RPC sector, private â€œbought leaf factoriesâ€, mostly in the Southern and Sabaragamuwa provinces and, in particular, about 500,000 tea small-holders, again located mostly in the above provinces. The segment delivers 72% of the National Tea Production and 65% of the National Rubber Production, and represents a community of about 1.5 million citizens. That important vote-bank, primarily Sinhala speaking, is concentrated in the South, Sabaragamuwa and in a wide swathe in the mid-country, between Pussellawa and Matale. In a presidential election these people may not vote for the man who, with one irrational and cynical gesture, impoverished them.\nSmallholder Segment\nContrary to popular belief that only a few â€œrich companiesâ€ will be affected by the wage increase, in actual fact, the smallholder will be the biggest loser.\nDue to contribution to total national production, the smallholder is the most important segment in both Tea and Rubber. Individual holdings range from around 50 ha to half-hectare extents or less. This segment relies on external labour for harvesting (and for other work as well), generally on the payment of Rs 40 per kg of green leaf. Consequent to the mandated increase, harvesting one kg of green leaf will cost them around Rs 80, with no possibility of additional revenue. The green leaf is purchased by the manufacturing factory, based on the Tea Commissionerâ€™s formula, linked to the Factory Net Sale Average, which is determined by auction prices. Any revision of the current green payment formula, designed to relieve the supplier, will bankrupt 427 private tea factories which, collectively, manufacture 70% of the national tea production.\nA smallholder, confronted by suddenly increasing input costs and diminished revenues, may respond by harvesting less often, resulting in lower crops and a poor standard of green leaf. That will affect made tea quality, resulting in lower auction prices, a diminished net sale average for the manufacturing factory and, again, a proportionate diminution of the green leaf payment to the smallholder/supplier.\nPoor quality tea coming in to the auction will affect demand, diminish the national net sale average and the competitiveness of Ceylon tea, with a corresponding impact on foreign exchange earnings. Exporters seeking quality Tea are likely to move to Kenya, India, Vietnam or Indonesia, and still buy reasonable quality at one USD per kilos less than in Colombo. The overall outcome will be massive hit on every aspect of the national industry, including value-added exports.\nAlternately, the smallholder may reduce costs by withholding or minimizing inputs such as fertilizer and field cultural practices. Some may either abandon their holdings or convert to other crops. In combination all these will lead to the diminution of national crop outputs which, currently, are at a three-decade low.\nUp to now the most efficient operational model of tea and rubber production was the smallholder segment. The mandated wage increase has thrown that in to total disarray.\nImpact on Rubber Industry\nThe Rubber sector will face a similar fate. Our national production has declined from 152 mn kg in 2012, to 70 mn kg in 2022 ( RRI statistics). With 65% of the production coming from the small holder sector, the wage increase will have an impact as in Tea. The prospect of reduced revenue will inhibit future replanting of rubber, which has a gestation period of six years and a productive life of about 20 years. About 60% of the national rubber production is used locally whilst annual imports are around 60 mn kg a year. The outcome will be a further decline in national production and an increase in imports, if local manufacturers of rubber-based goods are to maintain current production levels. The result will be an increased outflow of foreign exchange.\nKey Economic Factors and Paradoxes\nOf all major tea growing countries, Sri Lanka has the highest cost of production, highest labour cost and the lowest productivity. The new Sri Lankan wage will be about double the Indian labour cost, four times that of Bangladesh, and about 30% more than Kenya, where national average field productivity is about double that of Sri Lanka.\nThis 70% increase will cost the Regional Planation Companies an additional LKR 28 billion a year and with high gearing being a common feature in the sector, will also affect banks and other financial institutions adversely. The total additional annual cost to the industry will be LKR 81 billion. The current auction tea average is LKR 1,250 per kg and, with the new wage increase, the national cost of production will increase to around LKR 1,450 per kg.\nPrior to this increase, the Tea/Rubber wages board minimum determination was the second highest in the country. A demand for a proportionate increase by other local industries would lead to an economic disaster in the country. Another interesting feature is that a plantation worker clocking in for a minimum 25 days per month, working a four-five hour day, will now earn much more than a garment worker who works a minimum of eight hours per day, excluding meal breaks. In fact, both a graduate teacher and a fully qualified nurse, will earn less.\nA common perception is that a higher wage will entice workers to stay on the plantation, rather than migrate to other employment. Nothing could be further from the truth. Since 1992 to-date, the basic daily wage has increased from LKR 66 to LKR 1,700, whilst, during the same period, the actual worker component in the RPC sector, has declined from 32% of the resident population to 17%.\nThe only method by which the plantation worker can be guaranteed a fair income, whilst maintaining the viability of the industry which sustains them, is to move to an output-based payment model. Proposals based on the smallholder model, offered by the RPC sector, guaranteeing the worker up to LKR 2,000/- per day, have been steadfastly resisted by the trade unions as such models would liberate the worker from the clutches of the unions. An independent worker, earning a decent wage and in control of his own destiny, renders the union irrelevant. That is a fearful outcome for politically-aligned unions which rely on monthly worker contributions for their existence.\nConsequences of Political Intervention in Enterprise\nIn this country State intervention in the plantation industry has a dismal history. The nationalization in the 1970â€™s led to the dismantling of a management system of proven efficiency, and its replacement with a state apparatus, which, over the next couple of decades, led to the accumulation of vast liabilities. That, along with other inadequacies, compelled the re-privatization of the sector in 1992.\nIn 2016, then President , Maithripala Sirisena, on the advice of a Buddhist monk, overnight banned the use of Glyphosate, essential for weed control in the plantations. In 2021, then president Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, on the advice of an inner coterie with no experience in plantation management, similarly banned inorganic fertilizer and oil palm. The consequences were disastrous crop declines, freezing of both ongoing and planned investment, massive operational losses in all three sectors and the disruption of the Tea, Rubber and Oil Palm industries, from which they have not recovered yet.\nFor close upon 200 years, the local plantation industry has demonstrated incredible resilience in surviving a series of disasters, some natural and many man-made. This mandated wage, though, may be the last straw. Historians may one day record that the great industry birthed by a Scotsman named James Taylor, was strangled to death by a Sri Lankan named Ranil Wickremesinghe.\nAnura Gunasekera\n(The writer is a retired plantation specialist with over 50 years experience, covering the Agency House era, the State-management interlude and the Regional Plantation Company period.)

[&#8230;]','Democrats panic as President Biden has a dismal night\nby Vijaya Chandrasoma\nThe Biden-Trump debate, touted as the political face-off that would change the course of history, was held Thursday night at the CNN studios in Atlanta, Georgia. The rather unusual ground rules for the debate had been agreed upon by the candidates weeks ago. It was the earliest presidential debate in history, held as it was more than four months before election day in November.\nThese ground rules were considered to be essential to avoid a repetition of the debate between these two when they were candidates for the presidency in 2020. During that first debate nearly four years ago, the general consensus was that Trump was â€œunhinged, bullied, bulldozed and obfuscatedâ€ (CNN), talked â€œincoherently and rattled off unfounded and baseless attacksâ€ (NBC) spewed â€œmisleading claims and outright liesâ€ (New York Times) and showed he had â€œnothing but contempt for the values and norms that are essential to democracyâ€ (Washington Post). No one wanted to see that kind of confrontational fiasco again.\nThe moderators of the debate were CNNâ€™s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. The estimated millions watching from home had a variety of viewing options. CNN started the live broadcast at 9.0 p.m. EST on Thursday June 27, with every major network, domestic and international, providing a simulcast.\nThere was no live studio audience to chime in with cheers and jeers while the candidates were speaking during the 90-minute debate, a distinct disadvantage for Trump, who feeds off the hysterical cheers of the audience as he throws red meat at them during his scandalous speeches, with a lie per minute. Another disadvantage for Trump was that the microphones of each candidate were muted while his rival was speaking, so he was not able to constantly keep interrupting Biden as he did at their first debate in 2020. Interruptions which finally elicited exasperated responses from Biden: â€œWill you shut up, manâ€ and â€œItâ€™s hard to get any word in with this clownâ€.\nTrump won a coin toss to decide which side of the stage he would like his podium placed, and he chose, predictably, the right. Though the podiums were placed probably too close for comfort, just eight feet apart, for two men not overly fond of each other! They were required to remain standing for the duration of the debate, and were not allowed to bring any notes or have any contact with their staff. They were each given blank sheets of paper and pens.\nPresident Biden and Trump prepared for the debate in vastly different ways, which reflected their individual characters and styles. Biden hunkered down with a few of his closest advisors at Camp David, the presidential country retreat in the wooded hills of Catoctin Mountains in Maryland, 100 km. from Washington DC.\nTrump prepared for the debate by speaking to his voters at campaign rallies. Apart from his regular lies about his greatness and the constant whining about being the victim of the biggest witch-hunt in history, he kept harping on how he was expecting a strong performance from President Biden at the debate. This, after nearly four years of calling him â€œSleepy Joeâ€, and an old man who couldnâ€™t string two sentences together. His camp had realized that they may have set such a low bar for Biden that all he had to do to win the debate was to show up and remain conscious and standing for 90 minutes! Which is nearly all he did.\nAfter the stirring speech Biden made at the State of the Union in March, they thought that Biden would make a strong debater. So Trump â€“ and Fox News â€“ spread the lie that he must have been jacked up (high) on performance enhancing drugs for the State of the Union speech. They claimed he would be so energized for this debate also.\nTrump mocked that they (Bidenâ€™s staff) will be making sure â€œheâ€™s sleeping now, because they want to get him good and strong; heâ€™ll get a shot in the ass (perhaps cocaine) during the debate, so heâ€™ll come out all jacked upâ€, the insinuation being that Biden can only perform well with the aid of drugs. Trump was talking about requiring Sleepy Joe take a drug test before the debate, with allegations ridiculous, insulting and unprecedented. Of course, President Biden need not insist that Trump also should take a similar test, because Trump doesnâ€™t need any drugs to act like a crazy, unhinged buffoon.\nAt the beginning of the debate, millions saw a decent, elderly, but noticeably below par President Biden, facing an obese, orange-colored, convicted felon, in debt for hundreds of millions of dollars, desperate to win an election which will save him from a life in prison. Trump exuded false confidence, but he was well aware that his popularity is eroding after his recent convictions. He will face further problems after sentencing on the New York case of 34 felony counts on July 11, and heâ€™s terrified at the prospect of imprisonment. So this debate was a matter of life or death for Trump.\nFormer First Lady Melania Trump was conspicuous by her absence, while First Lady Dr. Jill Green was there to support her husband in this crucial moment in his life, as any normal, devoted wife would.\nThe debate was lost in the first three minutes. Basically, the debate was between the old man against the con man, and the con man won outright. The old man behaved his age, and one couldnâ€™t help but imagine how old and decrepit Biden would be at the end of a second term, when he would be 86-years-old.\nTrump behaved like the con man he is, lied and prevaricated as usual, but he was stable and controlled in his lies. He repeatedly made assertions which were outright falsehoods, but Biden was not able to challenge him. Trump stayed focused and hinged for the full 90 minutes. He was the obvious winner, but when all his lies are brought out into the open, the win will not seem that conclusive. CNN Flash Poll results immediately after the debate had Trump winning the debate 67% to 33%.\nOkay, it was just 90 minutes in the election campaign, even though it was a crucial 90 minutes. There are four months to go till the election. Ninety minutes of failure against all the hard and productive work Biden has done in the last three and a half years and the four months left till the election to redeem himself for one bad night. Resiliency has been Bidenâ€™s enduring quality in five decades of public service. Maybe heâ€™ll recover from his dismal performance in the debate, when voters weigh the progress he has made in the economy, unemployment, etc., which has made the US economy the strongest in the world.\nStill, I donâ€™t think Biden will recover from this debacle. I also donâ€™t think, after the debate, that Biden will be able to function in the toughest job in the world even till the end of his first term, much less for the next four years. When, at the risk of repeating myself, he will be 86-years-old.\nDemocrats are most concerned about Bidenâ€™s performance, and one operative said, â€œitâ€™s hard to argue that Joe Biden should be our nomineeâ€. The time to look for a replacement for Biden had long been overdue, but itâ€™s a matter of extreme priority now. After all, Biden ran for the presidency in 2020 with the sole motive of stopping Trump from winning a second term, which would have destroyed the country, and serving as a one-term president as a bridge to the next generation of Democratic leadership. He has fulfilled both these objectives admirably.\nThe Democratic Party has a wonderful group of extremely capable and experienced leaders who will be able to replace Biden for the 2024 nomination as President. Maybe it is time for Biden to retire gracefully with great honors and hand over the reins of government to the next generation of Democratic leadership.\nA young Democrat to the center of the Party will wipe the floor with convicted felon Donald Trump and his radical Republicans in November, and most importantly, destroy the existential threat that Trump presents to the Great Experiment of Democracy in the U.S.A.','Politics','2024-06-29','http://island.lk/two-aged-us-presidents-square-off-in-debate-for-the-ages/',NULL),(5,_binary 'fŒLG*T‚Å˜','Ranasinghe Premadasa Birth Centenary â€“ An evergreen leader','By Tisaranee Gunasekera &#8220;All theory is greyâ€¦ But forever green is the tree of life. &#8220;Goethe (Faust) For three months in late 1990â€™s, American author and political activist Barbara Ehrenreich lived the life of a low-wage worker.

She wanted to discover, first hand, how President Bill Clintonâ€™s welfare reforms were impacting on the lives of the working poor. Her experiences gave birth to her most celebrated book, Nickle and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America. In it, she focuses on the phenomenon of employed-homeless, workers who often do more than one job but are still unable to afford a roof over their heads. The conjunction of low wages and high rents create poverty traps from which few workers escape, Ehrenreich notes.\nAlmost 20 years later, sociologist Matthew Desmond in his book, Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City, demonstrated the cardinal role played by housing (or the lack of it) in perpetuating and exacerbating poverty in America. â€œFewer and fewer families can afford a roof over their head. This is among the most urgent and pressing issues facing America todayâ€¦ We have failed to fully appreciate how deeply housing is implicated in the creation of poverty.â€\nAccording to Jan-Feb 2024 Household Pulse Survey, homelessness in America increased by 48% since 2015; and an estimated 37% of tenants say they are very or somewhat likely to be evicted in the next two months. The European condition is no better. â€œUnaffordable rent and property prices are turning into a political battleground,â€ The Guardian warned in May. The only exception is Vienna. 60% of Viennese live in subsidised housing. The city builds 6,000-7,000 subsidised housing units each year funded by a 1% tax on all salaries.\nThe Viennese exception is a legacy of Red Vienna (1918-1934 â€“ when the Austrian capital was controlled by the Social Democratic Party) which was defined largely by its housing policy; the city built more than 60,000 new housing units. Sri Lanka, in 1979, embarked on a journey even more ambitious, to build 100,000 houses in three years. When Ranasinghe Premadasa unveiled his inaugural housing programme, it was ridiculed by the Opposition, stonewalled by the UNP cabinet, and criticised by the World Bank and the IMF. The mere thought of building 100,000 housing units in three years, and for the poor, was dismissed as a waste, an inflation-creator, and delusional.\nBut Premadasa would not be stopped. Like other top leaders of the UNP, he was eyeing the presidency and housing was going to be his â€˜qualifierâ€™ for the top job. Those politico-electoral imperatives apart, he understood the nexus between homelessness and politico-social and familial stability. During his tenure as a Colombo Municipal Councillor, he had spearheaded the building of flats in Saunders Place as part of a slum-clearance programme. As the Junior Minister of Housing in the 1965-70 government, he had built the Maligawatte Housing Scheme. As he put it, â€œShelter is not charity. It is a necessity.â€\nBorn and bred in Keselwatte, Sri Lankaâ€™s equivalent of the old Harlem, Premadasa knew well the bitter anger and despair of the marginalised. Homelessness was a time-bomb waiting to explode, he understood, especially in the context of the rapid but unbalanced growth which resulted from the opening up of the economy after 1977. He regarded housing as a major stabiliser, a way of giving the poor a stake in the system.\nIdealism and Realism\nAccording to the UN special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, homelessness is the â€˜social issue of the 21st Centuryâ€™. The seeds of this burgeoning crisis was sown in the final decades of the 20th Century, with the political de-prioritisation of the issue of housing/homelessness. The category of â€˜structural homelessnessâ€™ came into being, an ipso facto justification of political indifference and policy neglect. Shelter was left to the vagaries of individual fortunes and the free play of market forces. Homeless encampments became the norm, eviction a super-profitable business.\nThe Lankan experiment under the leadership of Premadasa in battling homelessness was doubly remarkable because it unfolded against this background of global indifference. And, contrary to the confident predictions of naysayers on the left and the right, the 100,000 Houses Programme worked. â€œThe targets were reached and exceeded by anything between 15%-30% â€“ an unparalleled success in a government Housing Programme in a Third World Country,â€ wrote Prof KM de Silva. (Sri Lanka and the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless). According to a report by the United Nationâ€™s Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, â€œThe programme proved to be a success in terms ofâ€¦target achievement, employment generation through the development of construction industry, and the â€˜benignâ€™ effect in the rental marketâ€ (Low cost shelter project in Sri Lanka â€“ ESCAP). â€œShelter (is) a field in which idealism and realism can blend to the advantage of all,â€ Premadasa had stated in his 1987 speech to the International Union of Architects. His programme, with its broad vision and hard practicality, certainly fitted the bill.\nWhile 100,000 Houses programme was a success in target-achievement, it also revealed the limits of state as house-builder, especially in a rural setting. It was also too costly and too centralised. These lessons were incorporated into the next stage of the Housing adventure â€“ the One Million Houses programme launched in 1984. Unlike the top-down method of the first phase, the second and third phases (1.5Milliion Houses programme) opted for a participatory model, involving beneficiaries at every stage of the process from planning to construction. The stateâ€™s role scaled down to that of assister.\nâ€œWhat we see here is a kind of respect for the poor and their abilities and capacities, or the trust that, if they are given some guidance and resources, they will be able to understand their own needs and respond to their housing needs in a better wayâ€¦â€ Colombo Urban Lab researcher Meghal Perera told a regional seminar on shelter in 2022. â€œFirst of all, the state allowed the people to design their own houses. There are stories of how every single household in this programme was given a file about the loans they could obtain. They were also given a square rule paper for them to design their own houses in the way they wanted. Secondly, there were community building guidelines and rules specific to particular low-income settlementsâ€¦ This programme called for conversations and workshops where women were able to talk about mattersâ€¦â€ (The Morning â€“ 14.10.2022).\nAccording to an island-wide research project carried out by the Premadasa Centre in the mid 1990â€™s, 34.2% of the recipients of the housing programmes were workers, 22.6% were labourers, 18.2% were cultivators, 9.2% were petty traders, 11.8% were self-employed or salaried employees. Low-wage earners who wouldnâ€™t have been able to afford a house of their own, perhaps ever; employed-homeless turned into homeowners.\nâ€œFor the last thirty yearsâ€¦when asking ourselves whether we support a proposal or initiative, we have not asked, is it good or bad?â€ historian Tony Judt wrote. â€œInstead we inquire: Is it efficient? Is it productive? Would it benefit gross domestic product? Will it contribute to growth? This propensity to avoid moral considerations, to restrict ourselves to issues of profit and lossâ€”economic questions in the narrowest senseâ€”is not an instinctive human condition. It is an acquired tasteâ€ (London Review of Books â€“ 17.12.2009).\nRanasinghe Premadasaâ€™s approach to development was conspicuous by the absence of such a purely economistic approach and the conscious incorporation of peoplesâ€™ interests as a primary measure of the desirability or undesirability of an economic policy. For Premadasa poverty was not just an economic problem to alleviate, a matter of numbers and percentages. He could look beyond the figures and see the people because he grew up among them, and continued to live with them even as president. Inside the Sucharitha Complex where he lived, there was even a school for the children of the area. Free of any theoretical bondage or ideological baggage, Premadasa was able to mix-and-match, discarding what didnâ€™t work and bettering what did.\nAs Sirisena Cooray, his political companion and friend of four decades, wrote, â€œMr. Premadasa had his own very different approach to developmental issues; his notion of slum clearance is an example of this. Usually slum clearance means the forcible eviction of the people living in slums to areas outside the city and developing these city locations for commercial purposesâ€¦ This is both a political mistake and a human tragedy. Most of those people would have been living in that area for a long time. They work close by; their children go to nearby schools. If you uproot them from that environment and put them elsewhere they feel alienated; their work, education, and social life get disrupted. What Mr. Premadasa meant by slum clearance was improving the quality of life of slum dwellers by providing them with better housing and other basic facilitiesâ€ (President Premadasa and I: Our Story).\nA necessary aside: Grabbing these commercially valuable land by expelling the residents into the outskirts of the city was a key component of Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s Colombo Metropolitan Corporation plan. â€œThe government is to demolish housing schemes constructed by former President Ranasinghe Premadasa, officials said,â€ (The Sunday Leader â€“ 25.9.2011). The Supreme Courtâ€™s decision against the Sacred Areas Act compelled the abandonment of this plan. But the Rajapaksas were able to nullify another Premadasa initiative: making public sector recruitment mandatory on competitive exams â€“ a recommendation of the Youth Commission of 1989. In 2007, Mahinda Rajapaksa issued a circular restoring recruitment via political patronage. When the JVP objected, Rajapaksa reportedly told them to provide their own lists (Lakbima News â€“ 9.9.2007).\nRadical in conception; conciliatory in implementation\nThere is a global tradition of developmental programmes which are (in the words of Amartya Sen) â€˜good and justâ€™. These are radical in intent but non-confrontational in style and regard economic strategy as a series of compromises balancing the interests of diverse socio-economic groups, for a common good. The Premadasa development projects belong in this category, expansive, yet grounded.\nThe 200 Garment Factories Programme was perhaps the best case in point. It amounted to a radical departure from the national and global norm of herding low-paid workers into specialised zones. Instead, entrepreneurs were encouraged â€“ via loans and garment quotas â€“ to set up factories in places where unemployment and poverty were rife. The state acted not as owner but as facilitator. The factories had to be new constructions, employ a minimum of 500 workers, pay a minimum wage of Rs 2000 plus meals, medical facilities etc. The success of the 200 Garment Factories Programme demonstrated that export-oriented and labour-friendly industrialisation was eminently possibly. An infamously exploitative industry (with sweatshop-type working-conditions) was transformed into its opposite, not through compulsion (let alone expropriation) but through persuasion (incentives). Development miracles are made on earth, via visions uncircumscribed by labels and political will.\nSirisena Cooray writes how in the at the Kataragama Gam Udawa, Premadasa built a common Buddhist-Hindu-Christian-Islamic place of worship symbolic of the ethno-religiously pluralist nature of Sri Lanka. â€œIt was an interesting concept â€“ you would come in together through a single entrance, branch out to go to different places of worship and once again gather together to go out. But the Buddhist monks opposed it; they did not like the ideaâ€ (President Premadasa and I: Our Story). It was another of Premadasaâ€™s dream, a country where primordial differences would not lead to bloody divisions. â€œSri Lanka has always had many ethnic groups, many religions and many social traditionsâ€¦ The history or the future of Sri Lanka does not belong to any group,â€ he said in 1990 and meant it. Lasting unity â€“ be it national or social â€“ could be built only by effecting tangible improvements in the living-conditions of all the poor, Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim.\nGiving everyone something to lose was the only true guarantee against societal violence and systemic instability, Premadasa believed. The rich and the poor, the majority and the minorities, all must be made to understand their need of and vulnerability to each other. In the urban housing schemes Premadasa built, flats were allocated via a pluralist policy. Every apartment block was representative of the larger Lankan nation, with Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim householders. During Black July, Colombo North and Central were spared the worst of violence thanks to this foresight. You could not set fire to your Tamil neighbourâ€™s house without imperilling your own, not in some distant future, but in the next few minutes. Gulfs could be bridged most effectively not by stirring slogans or pious utterings, but by tangible acts: shelter, employment, a leg-up out of poverty. The old Premadasa programme may not be replicable in the new times, but his innovative approach remains timeless; and indispensable.\nÂ \nÂ \nÂ ','Politics','2024-06-22','http://island.lk/ranasinghe-premadasa-birth-centenary-an-evergreen-leader/',NULL),(6,_binary 'fŒLH*T‚Å˜','The Future of India-Sri Lanka Economic Relations','By Rumeth Jayasinghe &#8220;Blood is thicker than water.

It was natural for India to see what it could do to stand by Sri Lanka at this very difficult timeâ€ â€“ S. Jaishankar\n\nSri Lankaâ€™s relations with India go back a long way. The first inklings of trade consolidated economic, cultural, and religious ties in both countries. In other words, then as now, it is trade that became a bedrock for relations on other fronts.\nGeographical proximity has since enabled these countries to enhance connectivity, as captured in the recent India-Sri Lanka Vision Document, which delves into areas like maritime cooperation, renewable energy, and people-to-people ties.\nIn the 1990s, a series of discussions between the two countries paved the way for a formal trade agreement, the SLFITA or Sri Lanka â€“ India Free Trade Agreement. It was signed in 1998 and came into effect two years later.\nThe agreement went a long way in strengthening economic ties between Colombo and New Delhi. In 2021, overall bilateral trade stood at USD 5.45 billion.\nMore recently, and more crucially, India granted financial assistance of over USD 4 billion and advocated Sri Lankaâ€™s debt restructuring programme by being the first creditor to give financial assurance to the IMF. It was also the first and largest contributor of food, fuel, gas, and medicine, among other necessities, to the beleaguered nation.\nThese have all led to a turnaround in economic ties between the two countries, bolstering prospects for more agreements. Four of these, in particular, stand out.\nETCA (Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement)\nThe Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement or ETCA serves as an addition, one could say sequel, to the current free trade pact between India and Sri Lanka.\nIntroduced in 2015, it proved to be controversial, not just among nationalist parties and professional trade unions but also other groups. Many feared that it would lead to an influx of Indian workers into Sri Lanka, notably the IT industry, at the cost of local labour.\nRegardless of this backlash, the proposal has gained a spotlight in recent months, with discussions resuming in November 2023 after a five-year hiatus.\nThe exact details of the agreement have yet to be disclosed. It is believed to include proposals for expanding trade in goods and trade in services.\nRemoving trade impediments and non-tariff barriers has also been recognised in the proposal. Though there is much ground to cover before reaching a final document, it is widely expected to be signed and ratified within this year.\nLand Connectivity\nThis is one of the more ambitious projects that the two nations have been eying for a long time, though its realisation has been delayed.Earlier this year, Chief of Staff to the President Sagala Ratnayaka began negotiations to translate this into real action. Following a visit to India in March, a mutual agreement was reached on conducting a quarterly review process on connectivity projects.\nThough security concerns have been raised, supporters of connectivity between India and Sri Lanka claim it will bring several benefits for Sri Lanka.\nFirst, they argue it can reduce transportation costs by at least 40%, giving businesses the opportunity to transport goods to India conveniently. The time taken to exchange goods can thus reduce since customs clearance can be processed and finalised quickly.\nThey also argue that construction of a land corridor can benefit the port sector, since inbound containers coming to India can be redirected to Sri Lanka, and Indians will have the opportunity to transport them via roads or railway.\nAccording to their reading, the tourism sector stands to gain enormously in terms of its catchment beyond Colombo to other parts of Sri Lanka, such as the North.Given that India has become one of the biggest tourism markets in Sri Lanka, this can reap dividends in future, though security concerns have swamped optimism on these fronts, and they need to be assessed.\nA land corridor can thus stimulate investments in Sri Lanka, especially the development of Trincomalee as a regional hub can be realised through this initiative.\nEntrepreneurs in the Northern Province can get the opportunity to expand markets beyond Sri Lanka, covering key Indian states such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Again, this needs to be taken with a pinch of salt, given the asymmetry between the two countries.\nDigital Infrastructure Programme\nDigital Connectivity is another area gaining traction between the nations. The Unique Payment Interface (UPI), introduced earlier this year, allows Indians to make payments in Sri Lanka through their smartphones, via LankaQR.\nBoth countries have begun trade settlements using the Indian Rupee, and an effort to create the Sri Lanka â€“ Unique Digital Identity Number is currently underway with an Indian grant of INR 300 crore.\nRenewable Energy Projects\nThe Sri Lankan governmentâ€™s approval of a deal with Adani Green to develop two wind power stations in Mannar and Pooneryn has been received positively and negatively, with critics pointing to the environmental impact and supporters emphasising the immense potential of the Sri Lankan renewable energy market.\nBut Adani isnâ€™t the only Indian company the Sri Lankan government has set its sights on. It has also signed a deal with the Bengaluru-based U Solar Energy Solutions to construct three hybrid renewable energy systems in Nainativu, Analathivu, and Delft.\nImpact on Domestic Policies\nWhatever critics or supporters may say, the growing Indian presence in Sri Lanka indicates one thing: that it wants to deepen economic integration with Sri Lanka.\nIn a recent interview, Indian High Commissioner Santos Jha stated that cooperation will always be driven by Indiaâ€™s goal of uplifting neighbour countries.\nThat reinforces the view that Indiaâ€™s growth trajectory can and will benefit Sri Lanka in the long-term, a view echoed by sections of the Sri Lankan Opposition as well, particularly MPs like Harsha de Silva. Leftwing and nationalist parties have more or less opposed that line, claiming that deeper integration will destroy local industries.\nFor Sri Lanka, economists argue, increased Indian presence in economic and commercial spheres will bring in prosperity and expanded economic activity in the island. Greater integration presents an opportunity to facilitate export diversification. This may or may not have positive spillover effects on employment, particularly in the north and east.\nOn the political front, of course, deepening ties with India will reinforce dependency on one country. That Sri Lanka needs to navigate itself carefully here is a no-brainer.\nA Way Forward?\nRegardless of rhetoric, the potential of Indo-Lanka economic ties has yet to be fully realised. Both countries are working together to create strong bonds and greater linkages.\nFor instance, President Wickremesinghe was one of the first leaders to congratulate Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his securing a third term in office. Modiâ€™s reply to Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored a clear message: Delhiâ€™s desire to foster connectivity in all dimensions between the long-standing allies.\nThe Vision Document developed by Colombo and Delhi underscores the confidence both countries have in these areas. The Sri Lankan government has set a target â€“ 2048 â€“ to become a fully developed country. There is much scepticism about this, but it is one of the proposals that have redefined its ties with India over the last year or so.\nTo be sure, these countries have faced several downturns throughout the history of their partnership. But both need to realise their aspirations. Whether physical connectivity can achieve this is debatable, considering the political fallout it can result in, particularly in Sri Lanka and even more so considering upcoming elections. Yet economic cooperation remains a crucial lynchpin in the future trajectory of Indo-Sri Lanka ties.\nRumeth Jayasinghe is an undergraduate at the University of Peradeniya who is studying management and is interested in economics.

LaLin i De SiLva\nToday (June23) is the 100th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister and President Ranasinghe Premadasa who was born on this day in 1924 at Dias Place, Keselwatte in Colombo Central. He had his primary education at Harvard Methodist Girlâ€™s School and Lorenzâ€™s College and his secondary education at St. Josephâ€™s College, Colombo where he studied up to his Cambridge senior exam. He also received Buddhist instuction at Hewavitarana Daham Pasala in Pitakotuwa (Pettah).\nIt is a pleasure for me to write a few lines on this occasion about a leader who stood by ordinary people through thick and thin. I had the good fortune of meeting him long before he had reached the acme of his career as President Premadasa was a long-time friend of my father, late E.P.De. Silva, who was a well-informed political reporter before he became the Editor of the Daily Mirror.\nPresident Premadasa began his political career in 1950 as a member of Labour Party under A.E. Goonasinha, was elected a member of the Colombo Municipal Council from the San Sebqastian ward. In 1956, he joined the United National Party running unsuccessfully against Dr. NM Perera at Ruwanwella.\nIn March 1960 he was elected as a Member of Parliament from Colombo Central but failed to retain the seat at the election which followed in July the same year. In 1965, he was first appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Local Government, Housing and Construction and the Minister when late Senator M. Tiruchelvam who held the portfolio resigned in 1968. After 1977, when J.R. Jayewardene became the first President of Sri Lanka, Premadasa was appointed Prime Minister. After more than four decades of active politics, in 1988, he became the second Executive President of Sri Lanka up to 1993 when he was assassinated.\nSadly the country lost a dynamic leader who was action and result oriented and had the vision to developing the economy island wide by taking industries to the rural areas and providing employments to rural youth helping to alleviate poverty in the villages. His Janasaviya poverty alleviation and 200 garment factories programs stand out in this regard.\nThe late President had the common touch, always believing in that ordinary people should share the responsibility of finding solutions to their problems. He was convinced that major problems including the lack of foreign exchange could be overcome by harnessing our own resources.\nPresident Premadasa, due to his friendship with my father, never forgot to visit me whenever he visited the Badulla District where I worked as Assistant Superintendent at Downside Estate, Welimada and Superintendent at Shawlands Estate, Lunugala. He was most concerned about the living conditions of the estate workers such as housing, drinking water1}, electricity, sanitation etc.\nDespite the then unsettled domestic situation in the country with twin insurrections in the north and south led by the LTTE and JVP during his tenure, he continued with the implementation of his schemes and programs for economic and social reconstruction. The thrust of his approach was the launching of the village awakening movement Gam Udawa (village reawakening) and Janasaviya (strength of the people). He had feeling for and empathy with the common man and reached out to uplift their living conditions in most of his programs.\nThe object of these, as stated by him, was whatever development the country achieved must benefit the poor and be focused on eliminating the gap between the haves and have nots. He looked for officials with a â€œMust and Can Doâ€ attitude to carry forward his programs. Thereâ€™s a wide perception that had President Premadasaâ€™s life not been prematurely cut down, he would have led the country to a progressive and disciplined future similar to many other developed countries. Such leadership is badly needed today.\nThough sometimes controversial he remains an iconic figure in politics today. Hopefully, present political leaders would learn from his mistakes and follow his good example and pave the way for a better Sri Lanka.\n(The writer is a retired planter and freelance journalist)','Politics','2024-06-22','http://island.lk/r-premadasa-self-made-politician-and-first-commoner-to-lead-nation/','http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SI-P08-23-06-PDC-2.jpg'),(8,_binary 'fŒLI*T‚Å˜!','RWâ€™s â€œjudicial cannibalismâ€ stirs up a storm','View from the gallery by Saman Indrajith The topics of the judiciary and its independence were a recurring theme during last weekâ€™s parliamentary sittings.

Both government and opposition MPs took turns discussing various aspects of the judiciary, with some using their parliamentary privileges to criticize judges and the courts.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe led the baton charge on Tuesday morning, explaining his stance on the recent Supreme Court determination on the constitutionality of the Gender Equality Bill. Using the words â€œjudicial cannibalismâ€, he found fault with the court for holding that the Bill violated the powers of Parliament under Article 4 of the Constitution and called for the appointment of a parliamentary select committee to study and make recommendations on this matter. But he did say he was not proposing summoning judges before the select committee.\nHis choice of words and focus on that judgment attracted both positive and negative reactions within and outside the House as well as in various forums beyond.\nShortly after the presidentâ€™s statement, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran suggested that it would be better to refer the Bill back to the Supreme Court for a re-evaluation rather than challenging its decision. He also expressed concern that appointing a select committee to review a Supreme Court decision could lead to unintended consequences.\nThese two positions formed the main thrust of discussion throughout the weekâ€™s sitting both in and out of the House. Many government and opposition MPs talking to each other in parliamentâ€™s lobbies and corridors were trying to figure out the presidentâ€™s real intention in challenging the countryâ€™s apex court. Some argued that the attempt to appoint a select committee might lead to a clash between the judiciary and the legislature, which was considered the last thing the country needed at this time.\nAfter his speech, the president visited the opposition lobby on the second floor of the Parliaemnt complex and chatted with opposition MPs on the emerging political picture. Maithripala Sirisena was also present and remarked that he was relieved his presidency was limited to five years, allowing him to avoid the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic repercussions. When an MP jokingly suggested that crises during Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s tenure might have been attributed to Sirisena, the president chuckled but made no comment.\nWhen Gampaha District SJB MP Harshana Rajakaruna passed by, the president said he had heard about an incident involving the MP and a woman at the Kotte SJB office. Rajakaruna said the incident took place not at the SJB Kotte office but at the opposition leaderâ€™s office at No 30 Marcus Fernando Mawatha. He described it as a minor incident that was quickly resolved.\nSome opposition MPs complained to the President that senior public servants had been granted duty-free vehicle permits but MPs permits have not yet been issued creating many problems for them. The president seeing Sajith Premadasa passing told them to make that request through the opposition leader and he would then discuss it with government MPs to find a solution.\nâ€œHere goes the opposition leader. Tell him your problems,â€ the president said.\nPremadasa continued to walk away saying that he heard nothing, and his ears were sealed.\nSirisena quipped that silence could be termed as an â€˜yesâ€™ in a court case, and Premadasaâ€™s silence too could be counted as an approval for the opposition MPs request.\nWickremesinghe stayed on in parliament participating in both the government group meeting and the cabinet meeting. By evening, many government MPs correctly anticipated that the comments on the judiciary would dominate discussions throughout the week. Some MPs met with the president and supported his proposal to appoint a select committee, citing instances where they felt the judiciary had hindered parliamentary processes and politics.\nWhen the president met with government MPs, some raised the issue of the Constitutional Council rejecting his proposal to grant a service extension to the current Attorney General. Upon hearing MPs argue that the stance taken by three civil society members of the council was legally wrong, the president nodded but remained silent. A legal officer present noted that the law does not prohibit a president from resubmitting a nomination that had been previously rejected by the council. Sitting beside the president, Ashu Marasinghe asked whether the same nominee would be put forward again for consideration; the President smiled without responding.\nThe following day, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that the phrase â€˜judicial cannibalism,â€™ simply meant the judiciary was encroaching upon the province of the legislature which is responsible for lawmaking. â€œWhen the court attempts to make laws or usurp the duties of the legislature, it creates a crisis because it undermines the doctrine of separation of powers,â€ he said.\nHe didnâ€™t stop there but continued to criticize judges and courts. He said that unethical conduct of a handful of judges has led to erosion of public faith in the judiciary. He cited examples of judges taking bribes, illegally tapping electricity and water lines, stealing whiskey from court record rooms etc etc.\nâ€œThere was an instance where two investigations confirmed that a Magistrate living in a bungalow next to the Mount Lavinia court had tapped both electricity and water supply lines to the court and helped himself to a reduced bill. This was uncovered when another judge complained of this illegal act to the Judicial Service Commission. The Commission sent an electrician to investigate and he nearly got electrocuted. He had to be admitted to the ICU to save his life. People point out that tapping water and electricity supply lines were non-bailable offences and question what action has been taken against the errant judge,â€ the minister said.\nIn opposition circles, some suggested that Minister Rajapakshe was reacting to recent court rulings regarding his bid for the SLFPâ€™s presidential candidacy leading to his criticism of judges. Another MP remarked that the judge in question appeared to be struggling financially, implying that if judges cannot live on their salaries and resort to theft, it reflects poorly on the judiciary. Yet another MP viewed the Justice Ministerâ€™s entire diatribe as a significant condemnation of the countryâ€™s judiciary.\nEarlier on the same day, SLPP dissident MP Dayasiri Jayasekera passionately raised a privilege issue, criticizing courts and judges. He claimed that his privileges were violated due to court orders that prevented him from actively participating in politics. He emphasized the importance of courts maintaining political neutrality.\nOn Thursday, NPP MP Harini Amarasuriya remarked that the Gender Equality Bill was hastily drafted, leading to numerous errors and weak provisions. She criticized the lack of proper discussion in the media and other forums, which would have allowed stakeholders to express their views on the Billâ€™s objectives. She expressed concern that certain provisions in the Bill, instead of protecting vulnerable groups, could worsen the existing situation.\nParticipating in the second reading debate on the Women Empowerment Bill, Dr. Amarasuriya said that the Supreme Court acted appropriately when a draft Bill containing vague and conflicting provisions was referred to it. Therefore, she emphasized that blaming the court for mistakes in Billâ€™s drafting process was unjustified.\nSJB MP Imthiaz Bakeer Markar expressed concerns about attempts to manipulate the judiciary and the processes of the Attorney Generalâ€™s Department. He urged Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena not to allow Parliament to be used for such manipulations and to take steps to uphold its dignity and independence.\nOn Tuesday the House debated five Orders made under the Tourism Act, three Regulations made under the Registration of Title Act, Crown Lands Ordinance and Convention Against Doping in Sports Act. On Wednesday Regulations and an Order under the Casino Business (Regulation) Act, a Resolution under the Coconut Development Act and Regulations under the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act were taken for debate.

The assessment made a few key judgments: â€˜President J. R. Jayewardeneâ€™s United National Party (UNP) government will continue to dominate Sri Lanka until at least 1989.â€™ The results of the October presidential election and the December referendum to extend the life of the current UNP-controlled Parliament for six years were seen as a personal triumph for the healthy 76-year-old President and a strong vote of confidence in his leadership and Western-style, free enterprise economic policies. The fresh mandate provided Jayewardene an opportunity to complete Sri Lankaâ€™s transition to a high-growth, free-market economy with several ambitious development projects aimed at self-sustained growth.\nHowever, the paper (Sri Lanka: Jayewardeneâ€™s approach to Democracy and Free Enterprise declassified by the CIA) further assessed that economic growth brought thorny problems. The government borrowed heavily to pay for development that would not yield dividends for several years. The UNPâ€™s most urgent priority was to curb massive deficits in the national budget, which accounted for an unusually high percentage of gross domestic product. The country faced growing strains in its balance of payments, and overall economic stability was a concern. Jayewardeneâ€™s re-election implied that Sri Lanka would continue playing a moderate and constructive role in world forums, maintaining a pro-Western orientation while seeking to promote investment opportunities. The UNPâ€™s dominance and the weakness of traditional opposition parties enhanced political stability but also risked corruption and indifference within the party ranks.\nCommunal disharmony was the most serious potential threat to Sri Lankan stability. Despite Jayewardeneâ€™s commitment to fostering better relations between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority, powerful UNP members were less conciliatory, and Tamil dissidents were likely to launch sporadic terrorist attacks. This situation was expected to worsen if Tamil agitation for a separate state flared into widespread bloody confrontation. A significant concern was the impact on democratic practices and communal relations once Jayewardene left power, particularly if a less committed democrat inherited the presidency, the paper observed.\nWhat is most interesting is that this paper described the personalities of key political leaders in the country, including JRJâ€™s successor. The CIA paper assessed the succession issue, stating, â€œAlthough we believe that Jayewardene enjoys good health, his advanced age increases the possibility that he will die during his six-year term. Under the 1978 constitution, the Prime Minister, Ranasinghe Premadasa, would become Acting President until parliament chose a successor from among its members. As the undisputed leader of the UNPâ€™s Parliamentary contingent, we believe Premadasa would be the most likely candidate to be chosen to fill out Jayewardeneâ€™s term. In this event, we would expect him to continue the UNPâ€™s free market, development-oriented policies.â€\nâ€œPremadasa, 58, sees himself as Jayewardeneâ€™s heir apparent. Highly popular, capable, and hardworking, he displays a common touch that Jayewardene lacks and has proved himself a major vote-getter for the party. According to Embassy reporting, Jayewardene holds Premadasaâ€™s political skills in high regard, depends on the Prime Minister, and works closely with him.â€\nâ€œIronically, Premadasaâ€™s low-caste origins, which have undoubtedly added to his popular standing, could derail his succession to the presidency. Sri Lanka has been governed since independence predominantly by members of the goigama (cultivator) caste, the highest in status and numerically the largest. Premadasa is the only major political figure on the current scene who is of significantly lower caste, and Embassy reporting indicates that some elements in the UNP are anxious to prevent his succession. We believe recent suggestions that the constitution be amended to provide for an office of vice president reflect an attempt to thwart Premadasaâ€™s candidacy by appointing a suitably high-caste vice president who would then automatically succeed Jayewardene.â€\nâ€œThe UNP has thus far displayed none of the debilitating infighting that has plagued Sri Lankaâ€™s other major parties. Although presidential hopefuls are looking around for support, we see little prospect of any dramatic power plays as long as Jayewardene remains healthy.â€\nHowever, R Premadasa, the man who ruled Sri Lanka after JRJ, showing ample qualities of a statesman, ended his life on the street. He was killed by a suicide bomber identified as Kulaveerasingam Veerakumar (alias â€˜Babuâ€™) of the LTTE, an armed group initially financed and trained by India. Unfortunately, it is questions that torn the political fabric, as the political dynamics resembled a vicious battle. Premadasaâ€™s routine on the day of his death exemplified his dedication. Rising early at 4 am, he began with yoga and perused the newspapers by 5:15 am. Intent on addressing the ruling United National Partyâ€™s rally at Colomboâ€™s Galle Face Green, he instructed his public relations officer to gather facts highlighting his presidencyâ€™s achievements since 1988.\nLater that morning, at 11:30 am, Premadasa inspected the procession he would lead from Sugathadasa Sports Stadium to the rally. Despite security warnings about Tamil Tiger threats, he personally supervised the preparations, engaging with supporters along the route. Tragedy struck when a young man approached, concealing a bomb. The assassin was cleared through the security cordon by his valet, an LTTE plant in his household, and permitted entry to the inner circle. The explosion occurred, killing Premadasa and several others instantly, marking the end of a turbulent era in Sri Lankaâ€™s history.\nPremadasaâ€™s rise from humble beginnings in Keselwatte, a poor neighbourhood in Colombo, to the presidency epitomized his ambition and resilience. Despite his flaws, he remained deeply connected to his roots, yet his presidency was marred by controversies and violence that shaped Sri Lankaâ€™s future trajectory. His death, mourned by some and celebrated by others, closed a chapter in Sri Lankan history defined by both progress and profound challenges.\nHis abbreviated leadership prompted many studies. Josine van der Horstâ€™s book explores the intricate connections between Buddhism and political power during R. Premadasaâ€™s presidency in Sri Lanka. It scrutinizes the aftermath of Premadasaâ€™s assassination, offering insights from informants who discussed the eventâ€™s unusual circumstances and broader implications. Meanwhile, Rajan Hooleâ€™s critical examination in â€œThe Arrogance of Powerâ€ challenges the official narrative attributing Premadasaâ€™s assassination solely to the LTTE. Highlighting discrepancies in the investigation process and allegations of collusion within Premadasaâ€™s security detail, Hoole suggests alternative theories that cast doubt on the LTTEâ€™s singular culpability.\nBradman Weerakoonâ€™s perspective in â€œRendering Unto Caesarâ€ provides a detailed account of the immediate aftermath and subsequent inquiries into Premadasaâ€™s death. Weerakoon, a close associate of Premadasa, acknowledges public perceptions of LTTE involvement but questions the thoroughness of the investigation and the broader political context. He discusses intertwined narratives surrounding Premadasa and Lalith Athulathmudaliâ€™s deaths, noting unresolved political tensions and conspiracy theories that have persisted without a comprehensive independent inquiry.\nWriting a preface to the Premadasa Philosophy, Ranil Wickremasinghe, then the Prime Minister, noted, â€œRanasinghe Premadasa was extraordinary in several senses. He was extraordinary in the magnitude of the social obstacles he faced and triumphed over. He was extraordinary in the extent of the creative constructive work he was able to do, positively changing the everyday life of large numbers of people. He was also extraordinary in the range and richness of his thinking. It is this last aspect which is brought out in sharp relief in this slender anthology of his thoughts. The range, depth, originality, creativity and sharpness of his ideas easily mark him out as a major political, social, and economic thinker, a major conceptual thinker, by any contemporary standard. Here then was the philosopher-politician, the profundity of whose thought is only matched by the sincerity of his compassion for people.â€\nPremadasa was a diligent reader, and he endeavoured to represent developing nations against extortion by wealthy countries. â€œHowever far, however close, or however powerful any nation may be, it has no right to aspire to control another nation,â€ Premadasa said. â€œIt is these same imperatives, sanctity of territorial sovereignty and integrity, which lead the government and the people of Sri Lanka to condemn interference by major powers in the affairs of smaller states. Whether this interference is in Central Asia, Central America, or the Caribbean, it is unjustified. The existence of governments or the assumption of office by governments which are disliked by their neighbours, is no excuse for overt or covert intervention. External invasion, subversion, or destabilization is the theft of decision making from citizens of the nation. We in the Non-Aligned Movement may only be able to resist these intrusions with words. But let the words ring loud and clear â€“ interference is wrong; interference is unprincipled; interference must stop,â€ he said at the 8th Non-Aligned Conference in Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1986.\nPremadasaâ€™s tenure was defined by significant economic reforms aimed at privatizing state enterprises and attracting foreign investment, alongside populist measures to alleviate rural poverty. However, his methods faced criticism for their ruthless suppression of dissent, including crackdowns on the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna rebels and alleged involvement in political assassinations. Despite efforts to engage with Tamil separatists like the LTTE through dialogue and military pressure, suspicions persisted regarding his handling of internal conflicts. His administration also struggled with heightened external interference in Sri Lankaâ€™s affairs, worsening internal crises. Despite these challenges, Premadasa made concerted efforts to uplift the country from poverty and achieve substantial economic transformation. Regrettably, Sri Lanka seems not to have fully absorbed the lessons from its past leadersâ€™ legacies, as political instability and external interference continue to afflict the nation.\n','Politics','2024-06-22','http://island.lk/ranasinghe-premadasa-triumphs-and-turmoil/',NULL);

The preparation programme was not carried out as planned. Thus, it became a cracked surface causing too much variation in pace, bounce, and sideways movement,â€ he said.\n\n\nAfghanistan were bowled out for 56 in 11.5 overs, the lowest score in a T20 World Cup last four game, and were beaten by nine wickets with South Africa knocking off the target in less than nine overs. â€œIt was ugly really. The pitch just deteriorated and it led to not a great spectacle for a T20 game. It would have been fascinating on day five of a Test match but for a T20, it wasnâ€™t up to scratch,â€ former England pacer Stephen Finn said on BBC Test Match Special, the commentary of which was used on the ICC website.\n\n\nâ€œI donâ€™t want to get myself into trouble and I donâ€™t want to come across as bitter or it being a case of sour grapes but thatâ€™s not the pitch that you want to have a match, a semi-final of a World Cupâ€on, plain and simple,â€ Jonathan Trott, the coach of Afghanistan, said after the match. â€œIt should be a fair contest. Iâ€™m not saying it should be flat completely with no spin and no seam movement, Iâ€™m saying you shouldnâ€™t have batsmen worrying about going forward.â€\n\n\nKent Crawfton was head curator for West Indies leg of the World Cup [Cricbuzz]\n\nDiscussing the issue further in a Mason and Guest Radio show, he added: â€œThere were a number of cracks. Pre-preparation wasnâ€™t done according to our plan. And it was just a little to dry when the preparation started.â€ He also spoke about the overall preparation of the pitches in the West Indies, saying the weather pattern in the Caribbean this summer was strange.\n\n\nâ€œThere were a number of reasons [for some pitches to go wrong]. First of all, we had a very strange weather pattern in April, even March-April, especially in some of our islands. It was extremely hot and dry. But I must say we all went for that period as strongly as we could in terms of getting our operations done.\n\n\nâ€œAll the venues we put in the work that was needed in terms of rehabilitating our squares and getting them up to scratch. And I think generally we were quite ready. Certain things didnâ€™t work according to plan. Based on what I would see could have been the management of our squares during that long period. I think it was one of our shortcomings.â€\n\n\nCrafton also addressed the issue of some surfaces having grass cover while a pitch like the one at the Kensington Oval in Barbados, which hosted the final, had a brownish look.\n\n\nâ€œThe aim was to have all pitches to be prepared with live grass, and all six venues were fully grassed ahead of detailed pitch presentation,â€ Crawfton said. â€œThe management of the squares during the tournament, especially at the Kensington Oval, where their matches span from June 2 to 29, is the outstanding reason. Excessive covering and not sufficient moisture retained in the pitch block. The green pitches were managed better than the bare ones.â€\n\n\nA part of the 29-day 55-match World Cup was staged in the US with 16 games of the first round played in New York, Dallas and Florida. For the eight games in New York drop-in pitches were used and Crawfton said he did not have much information on those surfaces where batting was difficult.\n\n\nâ€œWell, for sure, itâ€™s very difficult for me to make a pronouncement when I wasnâ€™t there to actually see the end result. But I did see those pictures in Florida when they were under construction. They were fully built and they were grassed when I saw them, and they looked level and they looked good. The only issues we have with pitches is that the grass we use on those pitches has to be thinned and light. Iâ€™m not sure how much that was done. Iâ€™m not sure how thin that grass was,â€ Crawfton said.\n\n\nâ€œAccording to our construction of pitches, the only difference we had with those drop-in pitches was that the grass that was used on those pitches was not the Bermuda grass, which we normally use on your pitches. It was more like that could have been a reason. I cannot pinpoint, as I said, because I donâ€™t have that information. But I know for sure the grass was different. But I donâ€™t think that a drop-in pitch constructed months ahead of the tournaments would have been a failure.â€\n\n[Cricbuzz]','sports','2024-07-08','http://island.lk/pitch-preparation-for-trinidad-semifinal-went-awry-concedes-chief-curator/','https://www.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/595x396/i1/c512492/kent-crawfton-was-head-curato.jpg'),(2,_binary 'fŒK)*T‚Å—ù','Perera and Hendricks  power Dambulla to first win in LPL 2024','A 154 run opening stand between Kusal Perera [80 off 50] and Reeza Hendricks [54 off 39] helped Dambulla Sixers register their first win in LPL 2024.

The 400 metres sprinters have won more international medals for the country than athletes in other disciplines. Yet the country had not witnessed a sprinter run the one lap race at the quadrennial event since Rohan Pradeep Kumara ran at the Athens Olympics in 2004.\nThe World Athletics confirmed Dharshanaâ€™s qualification on Saturday. According to â€˜Road to Paris 24â€™ final ranking published on Sunday, Dharshana was ranked 47 and he became the third Sri Lankan track and field athlete to book the Olympic ticket. Javelin thrower Dilhani Lekamge and Tharushi Karunaratne were the other two athletes to earn their tickets to Paris.\nAccording to the final rankings published by World Athletics on Sunday, Lekamge was ranked 25th while Karunaratne was in the 44th position in the womenâ€™s 800 metres.\nFrom the time he erased the meet record of the 400 metres at the Asian Junior Athletics Championships in Gifu Japan in 2018 the athlete from Seruvila was earmarked for greatness. The athlete trained by Asanka Rajakaruna was looked up to as the sprinter who would one day attack more than a quarter century old national record (44.61 secs) of legendary Sugath Thilakaratne.\nThe direct Olympic qualifying standard was set at 45 seconds and running sub 45 seconds was the target of the former Weera Keppetipola NS, Akuramboda athlete and his coach Rajakaruna when the new season opened in March. However his season opening mark of 45.30 remained his best as he vied for honours under different weather conditions overseas. It also remained Asiaâ€™s best performance this year till mid May. By yesterday only three athletes in Asia, one from Qatar and two from Japan had run faster than Dharshana this year.\nCompeting in Paris will be a huge accomplishment for the athlete hailing from humble backgrounds and that stage will be ideally set for him to try his first sub 45 seconds.\nDharshanaâ€™s qualification effectively ends Yupun Abeykoonâ€™s wait for his second Olympics.

They didnâ€™t get anywhere near close, as Indiaâ€™s vastly superior bowling attack made full use of a two-paced pitch while defending a total that was well above-par. The margin of victory â€“ exactly 100 runs â€“ perfectly summed up the contest.\nOn Saturday, Zimbabwe had opened the bowling with Brian Bennett, deploying his offspin against Indiaâ€™s left-hand debutant, and that had brought a first-over wicket-maiden with Abhishek out for a duck. The same match-up kicked off the second T20I after India opted to bat, and Abhishek got off the mark in international cricket off the first legal ball he faced, pulling it for six.\nIt was a sign of what was to come, but it also wasnâ€™t. International cricket isnâ€™t necessarily a better standard than the IPL, but it can be very, very different. This was a Harare pitch with a bit of spongy bounce and seam early on, and Zimbabweâ€™s attack used it well in the powerplay to keep India to 36 for 1.\nShubman Gill fell in the second over, chipping Blessing Muzarabani straight to mid-on, and the towering quick was Zimbabweâ€™s best bowler in the early stages, troubling Ruturaj Gaikwad in particular with his lift and movement in the corridor. Abhishek took time coming to grips with the conditions too, and at one point was batting on 27 off 23 balls.\nThen he looked to clear his front leg and hit Luke Jongweâ€™s nibbly medium-pace over the top, and miscued it high in the air over the mid-off region. Wellington Masakadza got under it, and put it down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbhishek Sharmaâ€™s savours the feeling of getting to a maiden international ton [Cricinfo]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom that point on, Abhishek was unstoppable, clattering 72 runs in his last 23 balls at the crease, hitting five fours and seven sixes in that time. Suddenly, the conditions ceased to bother him. He was rocking back to marginally short balls and pulling with fierce power. He was stepping out and freeing his arms gloriously to loft over the covers. A modest Zimbabwe attack, suddenly, was looking like what it was.\nThere was another drop along the way, Tendai Chatara running to his right from long-off and getting only the heel of his palm to a lofted drive off Sikandar Raza, when Abhishek was on 77 off 40. Zimbabwe were in the firing line, though, and with all the batting India had in the dugout â€“ they had left out the left-arm quick Khaleel Ahmed and included an extra batter, handing Sai Sudarshan his T20I debut â€“ he was taking nearly every ball on. Abhishek wasnâ€™t worried about getting out â€“ this is why he made such an impact in the IPL even though his longest innings of the season only lasted 28 balls â€“ and on this day luck smiled on him.\nAlong the way, he left a couple of bowlers nursing vivid bruises. Dion Myersâ€™ slow-medium disappeared for 4, 6, 4, 6, 4 in the 11th over, the pick of the hits a monster pull that hit the roof beyond the leg-side boundary to bring up Abhishekâ€™s fifty. Then Masakadza, unfortunate both to have dropped Abhishek and to be a purveyor of left-arm orthodox, went for 6, 6, 6 in the 14th over â€“ the last of them a one-handed swipe over backward square leg that brought up Abhishekâ€™s century â€“ before a miscue off the next ball ended the onslaught.\nGaikwadâ€™s struggle against the conditions and the rust of playing his first competitive cricket since the IPL extended all the way until his 38th ball, when he brought up his fifty with a pulled four off Jongwe. He took Chatara apart in the next over, the 18th, hitting him for three fours and a six to eventually finish unbeaten on 77 off 47.\nIndiaâ€™s main source of end-overs carnage, however, was Rinku Singh, who had been unlucky to miss their World Cup campaign while boasting an average of 89 and a strike rate of 176.23 in 11 innings at the time the squad was announced. He was in his element here, promoted to No. 4 with the perfect entry point for his skills, slapping the sixth ball he faced for a charging six over the covers and finishing the innings with a four and back-to-back sixes off Jongwe, who ended with figures of 0 for 53 in four overs. Not what he may have anticipated when he induced Abhishek to miscue on 27.\nIf Zimbabwe had any hope going into their chase, it lay in the composition of Indiaâ€™s attack. Having picked the extra batter, they were playing only four frontline bowlers, which left four overs to be completed by part-timers Abhishek and Riyan Parag.\nAbhishek isnâ€™t a part-timer in domestic cricket, and has plenty of variations to go with his stock left-arm orthodox, but he discovered how difficult bowling in the powerplay in an international game can be, conceding 19 in the second over with Bennett in an aggressive mood. Bennett took hold of Mukesh Kumar in the next over as well, hitting him for a pair of massive back-to-back sixes â€“ over square leg and then down the ground â€“ but he fell next ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Bennett got Zimbabwe off to a flying start with 26 off 9 before being bowled by Mukesh Kumar [Cricinfo]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was the second wicket Mukesh had taken with an in-ducker, after one in the first over to bowl Innocent Kaia through the gate. That sort of seam movement, with a bit of inconsistent bounce thrown in, was a defining feature of Zimbabweâ€™s powerplay: they scored 22 runs more than India did in that phase, thanks to Bennettâ€™s aggression, but they lost four wickets to Indiaâ€™s one.\nOne of these summed up how challenging the conditions still were: a bouncer from Avesh Khan skidding onto Sikandar Raza as he shaped to hook, forcing him to fend a catch off the glove to the keeper.\nZimbabweâ€™s innings continued to flounder after the powerplay, with Ravi Bishnoi looking particularly unhittable â€“ Johnathan Campbell, sweeping and reverse-sweeping with increasing desperation, failed to put bat on five successive balls from him, and bottom-edged the sixth into his body. Wessly Madhevere batted from the start of the chase all the way to the 17th over, and made 43 off 39 balls. Zimbabwe were eventually bowled out for 134 with eight balls remaining, with Mukesh and Avesh bagging three wickets apiece and Bishnoi finishing with 2 for 11 from his four overs.\nBrief scores:\nIndia 234 for 2 in 20 overs (Abhishek Sharma 100, Ruturaj Gaikwad 77*, Rinku Singh 48*; Blessing Muzarabani 1-30, Wellington Masakadza 1-29) beat Zimbabwe 134 in 18.4 overs (Wessley Madhevere 43, Brian Benett 26, Luke Jongwe 33; Avesh Khan 3-15, Mukesh Kumar 3-37, Ravi Bishnoi 2-11, Washington Sudar 1-28 ) by 100 runs\n[Cricinfo]','sports','2024-07-07','http://island.lk/abhishek-strikes-46-ball-ton-as-india-give-zimbabwe-a-thrashing/','https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_960/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/384400/384469.jpg'),(6,_binary 'fŒK+*T‚Å—ı','Seifertâ€™s unbeaten 82 seals win for Galle Marvels','An unbeaten 2 off 49 balls by Tim Seifert helped Galle Marvels defeat Kandy Falcons by six wickets with 17 balls in hand in the 9th match of LPL 2024 played at Dambulla today [07].

This can be lowered to speak to the driver or see the road ahead of them.\nâ€œWe also have a mini fridge with several features in the two seats and all the interior finishes made out of wood were done in Sri Lanka,â€ he said.\nOver the years, Autogroup gradually built a base of automobile enthusiasts who have eagerly followed the inspiring progress made by the company as it brought down, converted and shipped out the latest right-hand drive American SUVs, Muscle Cars and Pickup trucks from the USA.\nAutogroup International was founded by Chairman Peter Hill (of SriLankan fame) over 30 years ago when he embarked on a journey to convert left-hand drive vehicles to right-hand drive in Australia.\nHaving established Autogroup in Sri Lanka as a Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) business over 20 years ago, the local operations has witnessed growth in demand for right-hand drive American SUVs, Muscle Cars and Pickup trucks.\nOver the past two decades the company has grown steadily and today become a successful venture that employs a highly-talented and well-trained team of experts on par with any found internationally.

The SVAT system was introduced to simplify the VAT process for exporters and zero-rated supply chain operators.\nIt permitted these businesses to defer VAT payments on their inputs, thereby eliminating the need for extensive refunds. This system has been particularly beneficial in maintaining cash flow and reducing the administrative burden associated with VAT refund claims.\nPresident of the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE), Jayantha Karunaratne said that when businesses pay VAT upfront and wait for refunds, it can tie up a significant amount funds. In contrast, businesses defer VAT payments under the SVAT system, maintaining better liquidity and financial flexibility. Additionally, in the VAT refund system, refunds can be delayed, causing financial strain and uncertainty. Conversely, the SVAT system minimizes the risk of delays by deferring VAT payments rather than requiring refunds.\nHence, SVAT has helped exporters in several ways, exporters can manage their working capital more efficiently by submitting VAT payments, this liquidity is vital for maintaining operations and investing in growth. Further SVAT system reduces the complexity and time involved in filing VAT refund claims.\nThe government had previously announced that the SVAT would be repealed on January 1, next year. However, industry stakeholders including the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) lobbied this matter that Sri Lankaâ€™s exporters would be hit hard if the SVAT system is repealed without a strong value-added tax refund system. exporters would have to pay VAT upfront on their inputs and wait for refunds if there is no SVAT, this could tie up significant amounts of capital in VAT payments, leading to cashflow issues.\nThe efficiency of the VAT refund system has historically been a concern in Sri Lanka. Delays in refunds could make worse cash flow problems and disrupt business operations. Many exporters have expressed their views about the potential withdrawal of SVAT and as the voice of exporters, NCE also urged authorities not to abolish SVAT without a proper VAT refund system. The Cabinet has agreed to postpone the repeal of the simplified value-added tax (SVAT) to April 1, 2025 until a proper VAT refund system is implemented.\nSecretary General/CEO of the NCE, Shiham Marikar said, â€œAs representatives of the exportersâ€™ community, the NCE would like to highlight that we have not received any firm confirmation regarding a proper refund system or the continuation of SVAT after April 2025. If SVAT is withdrawn, exporters will have to revert to the traditional VAT refund system, where they pay VAT upfront and then wait for refunds. Consequently, exporters may still face significant challenges with VAT refunds.\nâ€œMaintaining a favorable environment for exporters is crucial for export-oriented economic growth and international trade relations. Policymakers must engage with industry stakeholders to formulate a solution that addresses the concerns of exporters while achieving the governmentâ€™s fiscal objectives. The Government must consider these factors and seek a balanced approach that supports the continued growth and stability of the export sector,â€ he said.\nThe post NCE concerned over SVAT withdrawal in April 2025 appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Business','2024-07-06','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/business/27050/nce-concerned-over-svat-withdrawal-in-april-2025/',NULL),(4,_binary 'fŒQ¿*T‚Å˜d','Ministry of Crab opens in Singapore','<p>Famous Sri Lankan seafood restaurant, Ministry of Crab by chef-restaurateur Dharshan Munidasa together with Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara opened its first restaurant in Singapore on July 3.

Some intrepid travellers did indeed arrive in the island even during the dark days of 2022, but tourism truly bounced back only after economic and political stability was achieved by around 2023.\nOne million tourists have arrived in the country in 2024 so far, although a slowdown is being experienced due to two factors. One is that this is generally the off-season for tourism in this part of the world and the other is the confusion surrounding Sri Lankaâ€™s visa policy after VFS was brought in as a technology services provider and facilitator. At one point, all visitors had to pay US$ 101 to enter Sri Lanka. After the uproar this created, the rate was revised to US$ 50 (with VFS fees included) for all visitors, except those from SAARC countries, who paid considerably less.\nBefore the VFS saga erupted, Sri Lanka was set to introduce free Visas on Arrival (VOA) for around 67 countries, a considerable expansion from the seven countries that enjoyed that facility (India, Thailand, Russia, China, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia) apart from Singapore, the Maldives and Seychelles that anyway had visa-free status as a result of visa reciprocity agreements. The controversy surrounding the VFS entry derailed this program, much to the detriment of Sri Lankaâ€™s tourism industry.\nNow that this proposal is to be presented to the Cabinet again, no time should be lost. The visa-free regime for 67 countries (nearly 75 with unilateral and bilateral exceptions) should be implemented as soon as possible. Tourists might still have to pay around US$ 10 to the visa system facilitator, but that is much more reasonable than US$ 50 upfront.\nIt has been proven time and again that visa-free arrangements encourage tourists to travel to such countries. A Sri Lankan, if given a choice between Singapore and the Philippines, would naturally opt for the former because it does not require a visa. The bottom line is, no one likes filling visa forms and red tape. Countries should open their borders to everyone, not closing them like fortresses.\nIn fact, while Sri Lanka was debating the VFS issue, several countries in Asia and Africa â€“ which are all competitors for tourist dollars â€“ threw their doors wide open, to Sri Lankans as well. Thailand recently expanded its visa-free entry facility to 93 nations including Sri Lanka. While Sri Lanka is faltering in its efforts to attract 2.3 million tourists this year, Thailand through this measure aims to attract a staggering 40 million tourists. Malaysia, Vietnam, Kenya, Rwanda and Cambodia too have introduced e-visas for all nationalities. Burundi, Comoros Islands, Djibouti, Guinea-Bissau, Maldives, Micronesia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Samoa, Seychelles, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu offer visa-free access to all 198 passports of the world.\nSri Lanka must also look for reciprocity when deciding on the 67 nations (and more) for visa-free access. It is too much to expect a country such as Germany to grant visa-free access to developing countries due to justified fears of stayovers, but there are some developing countries that still need paper visas from Sri Lankans. For example, rather surprisingly, citizens of Eritrea and Niger (and 155 other countries) can visit the Philippines visa free, but Sri Lankans have to fill complicated forms and show finances and get a paper visa to visit it. Similarly, visa-free access for Sri Lankans to Thailand, a Buddhist-majority country with links running into centuries, was not available until recently.\nIt is, therefore, appropriate that Foreign Ministry officials are also involved to negotiate visa reciprocity where possible. Sri Lankans still need advance paper visas for around 145 countries and the Foreign Ministry should begin negotiations to gain visa-free or e-visa access to at least 25 of these countries within the next decade. They have got visa-free access for diplomatic and official passports for many more countries, but real people-to-people contact happens when the ordinary people are free to travel and explore other countries and cultures. Ordinary passport holders should not be forgotten in visa negotiations.\nIf the present rates of tourist arrivals continue, Sri Lanka will need more inbound airline seats. There are several positive developments in this regard. SriLankan Airlines plans to induct or lease at least three more aircraft to meet the present demand and expand into new routes in South Asia and the Middle East.\nSome airlines, such as Cathay Pacific and Thai Airways, which halted operations at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, have returned to Colombo. Chongqing Airlines, an airline based in Chongqing, China, resumed direct nonstop flights from Chongqing to Colombo last week. Sri Lankaâ€™s aviation and tourism officials should encourage all operators to increase the number of flights and airlines such as Air France, Qantas, JAL, ANA, Virgin Atlantic, BA, Korean, Biman and Akasa to launch direct flights to Colombo. They should attend global â€œroute shopsâ€ where airline representatives look for lucrative new routes.\nSri Lanka is not the only grain of sand on the tourist beach. If our visa becomes too expensive or too time-consuming, tourists will head elsewhere. On the other hand, if it is streamlined and affordable, more tourists will click their mouse and choose Sri Lanka as the next holiday destination. Once they experience Sri Lanka, they will surely come back for more.\nThe post Resolve issues stifling tourism appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Editorial','2024-07-06','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/editorial/27336/resolve-issues-stifling-tourism/',NULL),(1,_binary 'fŒS\"*T‚Å˜‚','A decisive day','<p>July 2 is known as the date that divides the year in half.

As this is a leap year, by July 2, 183 days of 2024 have already been added to the history books while there are exactly 183 days to go before 2025 dawns. A special session of Parliament has been called on such an important day.\nA country that was on the verge of collapse two years ago, now leads a mostly comfortable existence. That did not happen automatically. Economic growth does not take place in a vacuum. It does not happen through mere talk. There are strategies and methods that make it happen. Many countries have gone through this painful process.\nA post-mortem does not result in the resurrection of the dead body, but post-mortems are carried out nonetheless. Likewise, similar post-mortems can be conducted about the countryâ€™s economic downfall. But this does not necessarily rectify past economic sins. Many experts prefer to call it â€œeconomic mismanagementâ€. However, such reviews can be used to put the economy on the correct track.\nSri Lanka revelled in debt. The printing of money with gay abandon was another dubious pillar of the economy. This combination, though never a recommended economic management strategy, was used by all Governments to keep the electorate happy. When welfare measures reached up to the neck, they fell into the â€œdebtâ€ category. Berating the 225 Members of Parliament till the end of the world will not resolve these problems. The public, 22 million of them, are not entirely innocent in this economic debacle, as they have been used to get many things from food to fuel at subsidised rates, with barely any concern for the countryâ€™s economy. Nevertheless, the major portion of the blame should go to the ruling class. Deficiencies in debt management and servicing, excessive welfare measures, populist decisions aimed at electoral victories and even the Covid-19 pandemic compounded to adversely affect the countryâ€™s fragile economy.\nFormer President Gotabaya Rajapaksa resigned midway, since all these factors converged and exploded at a single point of time during his tenure. That was a moment of anarchy. It was an extremely dangerous moment in the history of the country. Some even conspired to burn Parliament. Many who were offered an opportunity to take over the reins of the country at this decisive juncture made various excuses and disappeared from the scene. They possibly thought, with some justification, that it would be the end of their political careers. Taking on the post of Premier at that time was deemed that dangerous.\nBut Ranil Wickremesinghe, then the sole Member of Parliament (MP) from the United National Party (UNP), readily accepted the challenge and took oaths as the Prime Minister, despite knowing the extent of the Herculean task that lay before him. He told the cold, hard truth to the people â€“ that economic recovery will not be a walk in the park. He initiated crucial, even painful reforms, to stabilise the economy. Once he ascended to the Presidency, he did not deviate from these difficult but essential reforms, beginning with negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Having restructured domestic debt, he took on the arduous task of foreign debt restructuring, a deal for which has now been reached with the Official Creditor Committee and China. Such deals are not reached on the basis of personal connections, but rather on the basis of the reform program undertaken during the past two years.\nThere is no room for experiments at this stage. The IMF is renowned as the worldâ€™s lender of last resort. If a country cannot economically recover even with IMF help, it can become a â€œFailed Stateâ€. However, that danger no longer exists as the country has reached a decisive threshold in its journey towards economic freedom. This is a great achievement, considering the precarious situation the country was in just two years ago.\nIt is in this context that Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena made a special request from Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to convene a Special Session of Parliament to discuss the countryâ€™s next steps on July 2, in the middle of the year. The countryâ€™s future direction will be decided on at this session and also by the people at subsequent elections.\nAccording to the â€œgood newsâ€ the nation received on Wednesday from the Presidential lectern, the country has a grace period until 2043 to pay back the loans. This will also lead to a reduction in loan interest rates. Sri Lanka has successfully concluded two of the steps in the debt restructuring process â€“ domestic and bilateral â€“ while International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) are yet to be restructured. Sri Lankan officials are optimistic that this will also go ahead smoothly.\nThe forward march of the country from that point onwards will depend on the deliberations and decisions of Parliament and thereafter, of the people in Presidential and General Elections which are slated to be held in the near future. The people must make a wise choice at these elections, without squandering the economic gains made so far. They must think of the future generations, who should inherit a country free from debt.\nThe post A decisive day appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Editorial','2024-06-29','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/30/editorial/26694/a-decisive-day/',NULL),(2,_binary 'fŒS\"*T‚Å˜ƒ','New securityÂ challenges','<p>There has been a lot of debate in recent times over the size of Sri Lankaâ€™s military, which was expanded to fight a war with one of the worldâ€™s most&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/23/editorial/26218/new-security-challenges/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New securityÂ challenges</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunday Observer</a>.</p>','There has been a lot of debate in recent times over the size of Sri Lankaâ€™s military, which was expanded to fight a war with one of the worldâ€™s most ruthless terrorist groups. Having achieved that objective over 15 years ago, Sri Lankaâ€™s Security Forces now find themselves in peacetime, in a world that is somewhat, if not vastly, different from that of 2009.\nOur defence budget is still very high partly because we are having an expanded military and partly because we are still paying back loans and interest for some of the defence purchases made prior to 2009. In this context, there is hardly any doubt that the number of active duty personnel in Sri Lankaâ€™s Tri Forces, especially in the Army, has to be reduced in peacetime. While we refrain from giving exact troop numbers in these columns, it is a fact that countries much bigger than Sri Lanka have smaller armies. It is also worth noting that most countries rely heavily on their reservists if a conflict arises, whilst having only a few thousand active duty or permanent soldiers. This reduces costs vastly in peacetime.\nDefence experts have to arrive at a middle ground to determine the number of personnel that would be adequate to meet the current defence needs. As the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks demonstrated, transnational terrorism poses a real threat to all countries. The quick mobilisation of the Tri-Forces during that horrific incident, perhaps, averted further violence, though the authorities have to investigate the intelligence failures that let it happen in the first place. Just last month, four ISIS terrorists of Sri Lankan origin were arrested in India, which means that the ISIS threat to South Asia still persists.\nQuite apart from these developments, the whole security environment has changed, with factors such as transnational crime, cybercrime, human trafficking and smuggling, drug trafficking, gun-running and sea piracy coming into play. It is vital that we address these issues by deploying the maximum level of resources at our disposal, mainly because Sri Lanka is an island with a huge coastline and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that is 23 times bigger than the countryâ€™s landmass.\nThis is where the importance of intelligence, rather than troop numbers per se, comes into play. Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) has become a vital component of Armies, Navies and Air Forces around the world. ISR is even more crucial for island nations such as Sri Lanka. ISR is defined as the coordinated acquisition, processing, and dissemination of accurate, relevant, and timely information and intelligence to support the Security Forcesâ€™ decision-making process.\nISR systems can collect information from a wide range of sources, including electronic communications, optical, radar, and infrared imaging. Some of the assets used to collect this data include satellites, sensors, drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), aviation systems, specialised ground, sea or space-based equipment, and human intelligence teams. In fact, the latter, also called HUMINT, cannot be dismissed even with the availability of all these technologies.\nThis is why most Security Forces now prioritise ISR over the â€œboots on the groundâ€ approach. Proper intelligence gathering is essential to deal with all of these scenarios and threats. UAVs and drones are even more effective in terms of Surveillance and Reconnaissance because they can remain in the air on a single tank of fuel for over 24 years, looking at the ground or the sea with their all-seeing cameras which are much more sensitive than the human eye.\nThere is still a role for so-called AWACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) aircraft such as the Boeing E-7 Wedgetail, but human operators get tired over several hours and the costs (purchase price, fuel, and payments for personnel) are also much higher for these manned aircraft.\nThe Security Forces in developed countries are also moving towards unmanned ocean vessels including remote-controlled submarines and submersibles or ROVs. While some of the surveillance drones are really expensive at present, prices are dropping and defence manufacturers in the Global South have also jumped on the drone bandwagon, making them much cheaper than the Western equipment.\nIt is also time for Sri Lankaâ€™s Security Forces to focus on Search and Rescue (SAR) in a bigger way, now that defence imperatives have less intensity. They coped admirably with the twin disasters of the MT New Diamond and X-Press Pearl ships on the high seas around Sri Lanka. But they do need newer machines to do a better SAR job. For example, the Sri Lanka Air Force could be in charge of the proposed islandwide Air Ambulance Helicopter service. This will not only make the transport of accident victims (and other medical emergency cases) faster, but also expedite the transport of fresh organs for transplant in case there are deceased young accident victims. This sounds crude on paper, but it is the stark reality â€“ the faster the recipient gets the organ, the greater the chance of recovery.\nIt is important to maintain and uplift the morale of all members of the Tri Forces, while recognising the newly emerging threats and deploying them accordingly. Indeed, the traditional roles of the Tri-Forces are getting blurred, as they all need to be active on land, air and sea to face threats such as drug trafficking. The problems faced by war veterans should also be addressed, lest they fall into the hands of recruiters for foreign wars, as witnessed recently. At the end of the day, any changes to the Tri Forces should not be considered on the cost factor alone, and all operational dynamics and new security scenarios must be assessed beforehand.\nThe post New securityÂ challenges appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Editorial','2024-06-22','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/23/editorial/26218/new-security-challenges/',NULL),(3,_binary 'fŒS#*T‚Å˜„','A positive step','<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said that Sri Lanka will finalise a plan by today (16) to end vehicle import controls, starting with commercial vehicles and ending with all&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/16/editorial/25593/a-positive-step/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A positive step</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunday Observer</a>.</p>','The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said that Sri Lanka will finalise a plan by today (16) to end vehicle import controls, starting with commercial vehicles and ending with all vehicles in 2025.\nâ€œSri Lankan authorities have developed an initial roadmap to relax restrictions on the importation of motor vehicles by 2025, starting with public passenger and special purpose vehicles in 2024 third quarter, followed by goods transport vehicles in the fourth quarter 2024 and the rest in 2025,â€ the IMF report stated. â€œA detailed plan, including the implications on tax and reserve accumulations, will be finalised.â€\nThis was confirmed by State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe and other Government officials. Thus all restrictions on vehicle imports will cease next year, after a lapse of five years. Restrictions were placed on all vehicle imports (except for diplomatic vehicles and ambulances/firefighting vehicles) with the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, which was followed by an economic crisis in 2022 stemming from the pandemic and other factors.\nWith the recent disbursement of the third tranche under the IMFâ€™s Extended Fund facility (EFF), the economy has achieved stability to a great extent. Foreign reserves have also exceeded US$ 5 billion, which is essential given that vehicle imports generally use up around US$ 1.5 billion per year. With the economy returning almost to pre-pandemic levels, Sri Lanka eased restrictions on all other categories of goods including certain luxury goods. The import of certain other goods also reaches US$ 1.5 billion per year, so it is not fair to blame vehicle imports alone for any downfall in foreign reserves. However, with an uptick in tourism and expatriate remittances, the country is now in a position to recover any foreign exchange outflow vis-Ã -vis vehicle imports.\nThe Government has already partially relaxed restrictions on buses, trucks, earthmoving vehicles and farm vehicles, with more than 3,000 registrations of trucks alone in a few months. It is essential to remove all restrictions on the import of commercial vehicles, because they literally keep the economy moving. The Government recently introduced a new scheme to allow the import of 1,000 vehicles especially for tourism, a move that should ease the transport woes of tourists. The present fleet of tourist vehicles is showing signs of wear and tear, making journeys uncomfortable for tourists.\nThe Government has also allowed the import of electric vehicles (sometimes called New Energy Vehicles) for expatriates in spite of the overall ban on vehicle imports. This has been a silver lining amidst the import ban, as the latest electric vehicles can now be seen on Colomboâ€™s roads. Once passenger car imports resume, the Government should prioritise electric cars and hybrid cars, possibly with the granting of duty concessions and other incentives. Incentives should also be granted for the setting up of DC superchargers and other types of fast chargers. It would be futile to import more electric cars without a good network of chargers countrywide. The authorities also have to take into consideration other factors such as electric battery disposal.\nIt was also reported that three-wheeler imports would also be given the go-ahead from this year or next year. This is best avoided, as the number of three-wheelers in the country already exceeds 1.2 million and there is hardly any room for any more of them. Besides, three wheelers are a menace to other road users, being the primary cause of most fatal accidents apart from private buses. However, the authorities may permit the local assembly of electric three wheelers and also the conversion of fossil fuel-powered three wheelers to electric power. Instead, the import and assembly of quadricycles, which have the advantage of a fourth wheel, should be encouraged. It is also advisable to phase out three wheelers from at least the major cities by 2035, which is incidentally the year that Sri Lanka hopes to end registration of fossil fuel vehicles.\nThis brings us to the paramount need to phase out the import and local assembly of fossil fuel vehicles by 2035, if we are meet the Net Zero targets by 2050. For a start, the Government should first permit petrol cars with 1.0 litre engines. A limit of 2.5 litre engine capacity should be imposed for pure petrol cars and it is better not to allow the import of diesel passenger vehicles, except for buses, vans, pickups and trucks. These limits can be waived for hybrid cars. Many luxury cars are also available in these engine ranges, so this measure would not necessarily lock out luxury car buyers.\nIt is also time to end all permit schemes and instead formulate a more rational duty structure which enables more people to buy cars if they wish to. Permit schemes distort market dynamics, giving an advantage to the permit holders and those who buy the permits, sometimes for astronomical sums. Moreover, it is absurd that ordinary buyers have to pay around 300 percent tax on a car, while our peopleâ€™s representatives get them duty and tax free, with a laughable Rs.1,750 port clearance fee.\nAs long as our public transport system remains inadequate, people will aspire to buy a vehicle. If there is a clean, comfortable, punctual and efficient public transport system, people will either leave their cars at home or not buy them at all. That is what we should aim to achieve in the long term.\nThe post A positive step appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Editorial','2024-06-15','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/16/editorial/25593/a-positive-step/',NULL),(4,_binary 'fŒS#*T‚Å˜…','A new era for India','<p>History will be made today when Narendra Modi takes oaths for the third time as the Prime Minister of India.

This is incidentally the first time that a non-Congress leader has accomplished this feat in the worldâ€™s largest democracy.\nThe guest list for the ceremony also reflects Prime Ministerâ€™s Modiâ€™s â€œNeighbourhood Firstâ€ policy, with leaders of mostly Indian Ocean Region (IOR) countries invited to grace the occasion. Among them are President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Nepalese Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal â€˜Prachandaâ€™, Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay, Prime Minister of Mauritius Pravind Jugnauth and President of Seychelles Wavel Ramkalawan. Muizzu stands out from this list, as he is widely seen to be pro-China, having ordered the immediate departure of Indian military personnel stationed on the islands. This could signal a rapprochement between the two nations.\nPakistan seems to be the sole major absentee from South Asia, though it will be in the best interests of both countries if they work things out and make peace. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has been deadlocked for almost a decade due to bilateral issues between the two nuclear-armed nations. India has instead turned to BIMSTEC, of which Pakistan is not a member, to secure its interests in the IOR under the Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) policy.\nBut Prime Minister Modi, during his third term, should make a genuine effort to reach out to Pakistan and resolve the vexed bilateral issues. The strained relationship between the two South Asian giants, which has also spilled over into regional geopolitics, has affected South Asia as a whole on the world over. If these issues are resolved, SAARC has the potential to become another Schengen-style zone, with the free movement of people and goods sans borders within South Asia.\nWhatever his detractors might say, one has to acknowledge that Modi has turned India into a regional economic, defence and political superpower, if not a global one, despite the woes stemming from Covid.\nIndia boomed during Prime Minister Modiâ€™s first two terms, leapfrogging the United Kingdom (UK) to become the worldâ€™s fifth biggest economy and growing by 8.2 percent in the last fiscal year. His â€œMake In Indiaâ€ campaign has largely been a success, with Apple considering moving most of its production to India from China and Tata-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) starting to make its iconic Range Rovers for the first time outside Solihull, UK.\nElectric car giant Tesla has seemingly backed out of India at the last minute, but others are sure to fill in the gap. Modi also took a bold decision to privatise the ailing Air India, which is now controlled by Tata. A resurgent Air India recently placed a massive 500-plane order to match a similar order placed by the private carrier IndiGo.\nEconomy or defence, India under Modi will be mindful of one crucial factor â€“ China. The giant neighbour is a double-edged sword, as it is Indiaâ€™s biggest trading partner on the one hand (incidentally, both countries are members of BRICS) and a fierce competitor in every other sector on the other.\nIn this context, it is not difficult to guess why India under Premier Modi has got closer to the Western bloc through military blocs such as the Quad (Australia, India, Japan and UK) primarily to counter the increasing Chinese presence in the IOR. India has also been wary of Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), under which massive infrastructure projects are completed in Asian and African countries.\nHowever, Prime Minister Modi has carefully calibrated his response to world events without necessarily toeing the Western line. For example, India has remained neutral on the Ukraine issue, perhaps mindful of its robust economic and trade relationship with Russia. In fact, both Russia and India are working together for de-dollarisation, whereby Global South countries will be able to trade in Indian Rupees, Russian Roubles and so on. On the issue of Palestine and the Gaza War, India has always stood for the rights of Palestinians, regardless of the Government in power and it was no different under Premier Modi.\nDespite the Bharatiya Janata Partyâ€™s (BJP) rhetoric on the Kachchathivu Island, (an issue which has anyway not resonated with the voters of Tamil Nadu, where the BJP fared poorly), Premier Modi is known to have a soft corner for Sri Lanka and also for Buddhism. India was the first country to offer vaccines to Sri Lanka to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and two years later, when the economic crisis hit the island nation, extended almost US$ 4 billion in assistance which literally helped it to stay afloat.\nThe India-Sri Lanka relationship has gone from strength to strength under Premier Modi, with the signing of a comprehensive connectivity agreement covering fields such as transport, Renewable Energy, ports, petroleum, trade and education. Feasibility studies on the proposed land bridge linking the two countries are due to be started soon. This will be a huge opportunity for both countries to increase their bilateral trade volumes, as road freight is much cheaper than sea or air freight.\nPremier Modi faces the difficult challenge of uniting India, fractured by ethnic and religious strife in recent times. Fortunately, the 2024 election results showed that voters are not easily swayed by communal or religious rhetoric. This is a good sign that bodes well for the future of India.\nThe post A new era for India appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Editorial','2024-06-08','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/09/editorial/25063/a-new-era-for-india/',NULL),(5,_binary 'fŒS#*T‚Å˜†','Cricket: going global','<p>Cricket, the quintessential English sport, was once more popular than baseball in the United States, a fact that is hard to believe or comprehend now.

Today, cricket is the second most watched sport in the world, next only to soccer. While only around 10 countries play the sport at the highest level (Test matches), almost 100 countries play at associate or other leagues within the International Cricket Council (ICC) structure.\nBaseball, though very similar to cricket since it is also a bat and ball sport, has only a limited footprint, being played at the highest level only in the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea and a few other countries. But one cannot deny that the sport has a huge following in these countries.\nBut interest in cricket in both US and Canada was rekindled with the arrival of immigrants from South Asia, where cricket reigns supreme. After all, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have all won the Cricket World Cup. This led to the formation of cricket clubs in the main cities of Canada and US. Gradually, the native population also began to note this intriguing sport. As these clubs blossomed to the point of having tournaments, another groundbreaking development was taking place in the cricket world.\nLetâ€™s face it, Test cricket, though undoubtedly the purest form of the sport, can be rather boring, compared to sports such as football and baseball, which generally run only for three or a maximum four hours. On the other hand, even a 50 overs cricket match runs for a full day. Most people do not have the time or the inclination to watch a match for one whole day, leave alone five days. Thus cricket administrators stuck upon the brilliant formula of Twenty20 cricket, whereby each team gets to bat for just 20 overs. If team A gets 200 runs in their allotted 20 overs, team B has to score 201 runs in 20 overs. The best thing is that it only takes around three hours. It has thus been described as â€œcricket on steroidsâ€.\nNow, international Twenty20 matches are included in all bilateral series and a T20 Cricket World Cup was also started. Sri Lanka won this tournament exactly 10 years ago, 18 years after their magnificent victory in the 50 Overs World Cup in Lahore, Pakistan. Cricket also received a big boost with the start of franchise leagues around the world, where teams are cobbled together from a smattering of foreign and local players. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest such franchise league in the world.\nAlthough many say that these franchise leagues are â€œnot just cricketâ€ as the saying goes, there is no doubt that they have raised the profile of the sport globally and increased its visibility. In fact, the success of these franchise T20 leagues has spurred the establishment of a T20 cricket franchise tournament in the US itself. It is yet to reach the level of Major League Baseball (MLB), but given the South Asian Diaspora in North America, it could get there.\nEven 10 years ago, if someone said a Cricket World Cup could be held in the US, he would have been laughed out of hand. But now, the boot is literally on the other foot as the US is hosting the T20 Cricket World Cup for the very first time, along with the more established West Indies. This is the biggest breakthrough for cricket in North America in recent memory.\nEven more significantly, the US is getting two renovated and one all-new cricket stadia to host 16 matches of the tournament, which started yesterday. The stadia in New York, Texas and Florida will hopefully be dedicated to cricket once the tournament ends, helping to popularise the game in the Land of the Free, although the one in New York is modular and can easily be dismantled and refitted elsewhere. With more exposure, Americans and Canadians might get used to this beautiful game. Indeed, that other beautiful game â€“ soccer â€“ has gained a sizable following in the US after a franchise model was introduced. Cricket might have a similar trajectory.\nThe ICC was heavily criticised for limiting the previous recent editions of all World Cups to the elite cricket playing countries. This limits the opportunities of emerging nations to play against the top teams and also the broadest coverage. This simple theory was well understood by World Rugby, which has vastly expanded the number of nations in their most recent edition of the World Cup. Rugby, also played by a limited number of countries, faced the same challenge of taking it to more corners of the world. Since the expansion, rugby has gained traction in many more countries.\nThis time, sanity has prevailed at the ICC. They have expanded the tournament to cover 20 nations, including of course, the US. Among the other lesser known countries are Oman, Canada, Namibia, Uganda, PNG and Nepal. From the Test playing nations, only Zimbabwe has been left out, as it was unable to qualify.\nRecent newcomers to the Test arena Ireland and Afghanistan are also in the fray, along with the Netherlands, which has been playing cricket at this level for almost two decades. Participating in the T20 World Cup will give cricket in these countries a tremendous boost, encouraging more youngsters to take up the sport in addition to or instead of soccer, the planetâ€™s number one sport. The ICC must, however, keep the momentum going, by investing further in the cricket infrastructure of these emerging nations and giving them regular tournaments and tours.\nThe post Cricket: going global appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Editorial','2024-06-01','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/02/editorial/24530/cricket-going-global/',NULL),(6,_binary 'fŒS$*T‚Å˜‡','Facing future pandemics','<p>Apart from taking more than seven million precious lives, the Covid-19 pandemic brought one other fact to the fore â€“ the inequality between developed and developing worlds.

The Global South watched with horror and dismay as the First World ordered and hoarded almost all the vaccines as soon as they came out of the production lines back in 2021, ignoring appeals by the World Health Organization (WHO) and GAVI, the vaccine alliance.\nThe same story unfolded with Covid-19 treatments such as Paxlovid, which were exclusively ordered by developed nations. Western pharmaceutical companies also held on tightly to their patents for vaccines and treatments, without transferring that technology to vaccine manufacturers based in developing countries. In fact, the pandemic has come and gone, but some African countries are yet to receive any vaccines.\nThis was, of course, just one lesson that the world learned from the Covid-19 pandemic. The plain truth is that the world was not prepared to face a pandemic of that scale, despite having faced a few scares such as Ebola, SARS and bird flu. The debate on the origins of the virus still goes on. Coordination on pandemic relief was minimal. We are still learning about the effects of Long Covid, where the symptoms of the disease linger on in the body long after the virus has left.\nAlthough a span of 100 years separated the Spanish Flu and Covid-19, much the same methods were used to control the latter â€“ lockdowns, social distancing, hand washing and wearing masks. This means that viruses still have the upper hand, in spite of major advances in health and medical science.\nBut now, there is a growing perception that the next pandemic â€“ dubbed â€œDisease Xâ€ could be many times more deadly than Covid. In the extreme, it could even be an Extinction Level Event (ELE) with much of humanity wiped out. The best answer is vigilance and research on a global scale, avoiding the many pitfalls that made Covid-19 worse than it actually was.\nAway from the glare of publicity, this is exactly what is happening. For more than two years, countries have worked together towards one historic goal â€“ to ensure the world is better prepared for the next pandemic by learning lessons from the devastation caused by Covid-19.\nAt a time when conflicts, politics and economics have wrought destruction, discord and division, Governments have found a way to work collaboratively to forge a new global agreement to protect the world from inevitable future pandemics. Indeed, the next pandemic is a question of â€œwhenâ€ not â€œifâ€. This effort, driven by hundreds of negotiators from 195 nations, was launched just as Covid was receding.\nAt the core of this effort is the principle that the world must never again be left so vulnerable to another pandemic. Governments must never again fail to cooperate in sharing vital information, medical equipment and medicines. Never again can the worldâ€™s poorest countries and communities be left at the end of the queue when it comes to access to life-saving tools like vaccines.\nThe Member States of the WHO will thus undertake two landmark, parallel efforts: to start negotiating a first-ever Pandemic Agreement (PA) to prevent, prepare for and respond to pandemics, while making targeted amendments to the existing International Health Regulations (IHR). The outcomes of these vital negotiations are scheduled to be considered at the 77th World Health Assembly (WHA) that will open in Geneva tomorrow (27).\nThe PA will ensure real-time access to the capacities needed to protect health workers and communities from a pandemic threat, so that the world will not again experience a repeat of the inequities in access to vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics, ventilators, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Rapid Antigen (RA) tests, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other vital tools. The PA should also have provisions for the rich countries to supply advanced equipment such as Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machines to their poorer cousins. Sri Lanka, for example, has just two of these rather expensive life-saving machines.\nThe PA will also ensure that there are no weak links in the chain of defence against pathogens with pandemic potential. This requires collaboration between countries to share what is needed, including pathogen studies, diagnostics, real-time information and medical resources such as genetic sequencing machines. More studies are needed on Zoonotic diseases, whereby viruses jump from animal species to humans. This is how Covid-19 is believed to have originated.\nThe PA should also make it mandatory for Western pharmaceutical companies to share their technology or patents with vaccine and drug manufacturers in the Global South, such as the Serum Institute of India (SII), the worldâ€™s largest vaccine maker by volume. Better still, they can make the vaccine formulas open-source, so that companies in the Global South can make the vaccines without paying huge royalties or licensing fees to Western companies.\nGuidelines on avoiding the spread of misinformation and fake news through social media and even the mainstream media are also vital in the battle against pandemics. At least a million Covid-19 deaths could have been avoided if these patients did not fall prey to misinformation (called an infodemic) on vaccines, treatments and masks.\nThe mask mandate became a political issue in many countries, leading to many avoidable deaths. It is thus vital to keep the public informed with the correct facts every step of the way during a pandemic. That could mean the difference between life and death when Disease X eventually strikes.\nThe post Facing future pandemics appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Editorial','2024-05-25','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/05/26/editorial/23975/facing-future-pandemics/',NULL),(7,_binary 'fŒS$*T‚Å˜ˆ','A new era for Singapore','<p>Unlike many Asian countries where political volatility is the norm, Singapore rarely witnesses political upheavals of any kind.

In this sense, the City State is a bastion of stability, both politically and economically.\nSingaporeâ€™s success on the world stage â€“ from the sleepy backwater it was when Sir Stamford Raffles took control in 1819 to the financial powerhouse it is today â€“ can largely be attributed to the vision and perseverance of one legendary Statesman â€“ Lee Kuan Yew. Incidentally, he was an ardent admirer of Sri Lanka who wanted to model Singapore after that Pearl of the Indian Ocean, but was dismayed by its downward spiral in an ethnic imbroglio.\nThus he made racial amity a cornerstone of his policies for Singapore and curbed corruption to the maximum possible extent. There may be other reasons, but these are the two main factors that transformed Singapore to the status of a developed nation while its neighbouring countries stagnated.\nLee Kuan yew was succeeded in the Premierâ€™s position by his son Lee Hsien Loong. One may call it nepotism or dynastic politics, but unlike in many other Asian countries where it is a synonym for corruption, Loong (72) took Singapore to an even higher level.\nBut in grooming a set of future political leaders outside his family circle â€“ the so-called 4G group â€“ he also made certain that Singapore would get out of dynastic politics. In his final major speech on May 1, Lee urged people to rally behind the incoming Prime Minister and emphasised that Singaporeâ€™s stable politics had enabled long-term planning.\nNow, in a seismic shift for the tiny but mighty country, Peopleâ€™s Action Party (PAP) 4G frontliner Lawrence Wong has been sworn in as Singaporeâ€™s first new Prime Minister in 20 years. In fact, he is only its fourth leader since Independence in 1965 and the carefully calibrated power transfer is aimed at ensuring continuity in the wealthy City State. Wong is also the first Singaporean leader born after its Independence.\nAfter assuming office in a televised ceremony, Wong pledged to lead â€œwith humility and a deep sense of dutyâ€ towards Singapore and its six million people. He promised to devote â€œevery ounce of my energyâ€ to them. At just 51, time and age are firmly on his side as he seeks to continue the momentum that has propelled Singapore to its prime position. Wongâ€™s expertise as an economist and his retention of the Finance portfolio will also come in useful as Singapore faces global economic headwinds.\nWong rose to prominence in 2020 as co-chairperson of the Pandemic Task Force (PTF) and was named Leeâ€™s successor in April 2022 after a series of consultations between the political leadership and his peers. He was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister and led a high-profile public consultation exercise to chart a â€œSocial Compactâ€ between the Government and the people on dealing with issues such as sustainability, inequality and employment.\nâ€œThis is a passing of the baton not just between leadership teams but also across generations,â€ Wong said. â€œWe will lead in our own way. We will continue to think boldly and think far.â€ These are bold words that Singaporeans need to hear now more than ever, but surprisingly, Wong was not the first choice for the PMâ€™s post. That honour went to Heng Swee Keat, a former Central Bank Chief and Education Minister. However, he withdrew his nomination in 2021. This paved the way for Wongâ€™s prominence and rise. Premier Wong has warned that Singapore must brace for a â€œmessier, riskier and more violent worldâ€ by staying united and blazing new trails. Indeed, these words apply to all countries in our region, not just Singapore.\nBeing at the crossroads of the East-West shipping routes, Singapore literally has to straddle the regionâ€™s increasingly volatile geopolitical waters, with a rising China on one side and the US and its allies on the other. However, Singapore has been adroitly balancing its foreign policy imperatives without falling into the orbit of any side. Singaporeâ€™s own unique governing model may have something to do with this ambivalence. Nevertheless, Singapore has been quietly building up its defence capacity and capability to face any eventuality. Wong has received the reins of his island nation at a critical juncture in this context.\nDomestically, Premier Wong will have to worry about factors such as the falling birth rate, the housing and rental crisis, the Climate Crisis (a critical factor for a small island) and even the repercussions of a still-reverberating corruption scandal involving former senior Minister S. Iswaran as well as a romantic scandal involving two PAP personalities. These have unfortunately smeared Singaporeâ€™s zero-corruption reputation and Wong will have to crack the whip harder in this regard. A resurgent Opposition could also pose a greater challenge to the PAP at the next General Election due in 2025, though a victory for the PA is certain at this stage.\nRelations between Sri Lanka and Singapore have always been excellent and to this day, Singapore is one of the very few countries that grant visa-free access to Sri Lankan citizens. The two countries have also signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that will spur two-way trade by eliminating tariffs for 80 percent of all tariff lines through staging periods of up to 15 years. There is no doubt that this robust relationship will reach greater heights under Premier Wongâ€™s watch.\nThe post A new era for Singapore appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Editorial','2024-05-18','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/05/19/editorial/23595/a-new-era-for-singapore/',NULL),(8,_binary 'fŒS$*T‚Å˜‰','A tipping point for Renewable Energy','<p>Sri Lanka, located in the equatorial belt, is blessed with an abundance of sun and wind.

It is, therefore, somewhat surprising that we are still lagging behind in the Renewable Energy (RE) race. However, other countries, both developed and developing, have raced far ahead. In fact, some countries can already generate 100 percent of their power demand from RE alone for short periods. Soon, they will be able to do so 24/7.\nWe are penning these words in the context of the latest reports that RE will this year shrink fossil fuelsâ€™ reigning share of the global electricity market for the first time. That is the key finding of Ember, a leading energy think tank based in London, which on Wednesday published its first comprehensive Global Electricity Review (GER) analysing data from 215 countries including Sri Lanka.\nThe report disclosed that thanks to the galloping pace of new Solar and Wind capacity, RE has been claiming almost all growth in electricity demand for five years, leaving fossil fuels stagnant. But this year, said Ember, they will also roll back fossil fuelsâ€™ market share by 2 percent â€“ the beginning of a decade-long process of knocking them out of electricity production altogether in three dozen developed economies. Two percent may not sound like much, but given the vast extent of the fossil fuel industry, it is a creditable achievement.\nRenewables expanded by an average of 3.5 percent a year during the past decade, compared with an annual 1.5 percent in the previous decade, as prices for Photo Voltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines dropped and their productivity or efficiency soared. Ember found that the world already produced a record 30 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources last year.\nIn addition to the full-year effect of newly installed capacity, Ember says that a 50 percent collapse of solar panel prices in the final months of 2023 will also lead to record new installations around the world. As a result, RE generation this year will add a mammoth 1,221 terawatt hours of electricity supply, compared with 513 TWh added last year. That means trouble for coal-fired power stations, but it could also spell danger for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). As more countries encourage Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales, retail fossil fuel sales will also experience a decline, albeit a slight one as around 95 percent of vehicles around the world still run on petrol and diesel. But this could change within the next 10 years as BEVs gradually gain mass acceptance.\nBut one country in particular has driven the massive change in RE and BEV growth â€“ China. Last year alone, it installed half the worldâ€™s solar panels and 60 percent of the wind turbines, easily rating as the Green Energy transition leader. It manufactures as much as 85 percent of the solar panels the rest of the world installs.\nChina has also become a leader in the electrification of transport and heating, two of the most polluting sectors of the economy after electricity production. Chinaâ€™s BYD has overtaken Tesla in terms of the number of BEVs sold worldwide. Last year it put more electric vehicles on the road and heat pumps into homes than the rest of the world combined, and was responsible for almost all new electricity demand.\nOf course, the BEV revolution wonâ€™t work if the electricity for the chargers is generated by fossil or thermal fuels. Then BEVs will still be burning fossil fuel in reality, even if they nominally run on battery power. Instead, the installation of solar-based chargers (and also ultra-expensive DC superchargers) should be encouraged wherever possible.\nSri Lankan authorities, who are most likely to permit the import of mostly BEVs from next year, must bear this in mind. Chargers depending on RE technologies will actually make BEV-based transport carbon neutral. When approving the entry of several foreign players to the local retrial fuel market, the authorities should have insisted upon having at least one electric car charger at each new filling station, with retrofitting an option for existing ones.\nSri Lanka has set its sights on generating 70 percent of the projected power demand from RE sources by 2030. Just as the deal reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will have to be honoured more or less by any incoming Government, the same policy should apply to RE. All political parties must thus be committed to grant concessions and incentives to encourage the switch to RE and BEVs.\nOne cannot also forget that the fossil fuel industry is trying its best to â€œgreenwashâ€ their so-called Dino-Juice fuels as well as oil exploration even in pristine environments. They are very closely linked to the political establishments, especially the far-Right and Conservative ones in both developed and developing countries. Some of them have actually urged Governments to roll back RE initiatives. They also try to mislead consumers on RE and BEVs, which could be one reason why BEV sales have fallen in certain key markets.\nBut make no mistake, RE and BEVs are the future. Governments must be bold enough to phase out fossil fuels both for energy generation and transport as soon as possible. Most countries including Sri Lanka have set a realistic target (2035) in this regard and they must stick to it, despite the ugly machinations of the fossil fuel lobby.\nThe post A tipping point for Renewable Energy appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Editorial','2024-05-11','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/05/12/editorial/23019/a-tipping-point-for-renewable-energy/',NULL),(9,_binary 'fŒS%*T‚Å˜Š','Let sanity prevail','<p>The recent move by the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) to offer medical graduate courses on a fee-levying basis has created an uproar, with some elements throwing a&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/05/05/editorial/22461/let-sanity-prevail/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Let sanity prevail</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunday Observer</a>.</p>','The recent move by the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) to offer medical graduate courses on a fee-levying basis has created an uproar, with some elements throwing a spanner in the works. The Government Medical Officersâ€™ Association (GMOA), which itself previously acknowledged the glaring shortage of doctors in Government hospitals, has however, opposed every move to broaden medical education, starting with the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC), then the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and now, the KDU. This, at a time when the paucity of doctors has been aggravated by the mass migration of doctors.\nTheir opposition defies logic, especially in the light of reports that many students who have missed out on admission to the State medical colleges by just a few marks have applied for the KDU course. This gives the lie to the allegation that even those who have failed the GCE Advanced Level examination could apply and become doctors. But the best point is not even that â€“ the KDU course fee is just Rs.12.5 million, whereas just one year in a foreign university will cost that amount. One can imagine the savings in terms of foreign exchange. This in itself could be a lifeline for our foreign reserves.\nIf students peruse the Education section of this newspaper, they will realise that there are plenty of Government and private educational institutions that can offer similar globally recognised courses and degrees at a fraction of the cost of overseas universities. Students sometimes get the option of completing the course in another country and even gaining employment and Permanent Residency (PR).\nSaving foreign exchange is often cited as the cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre of establishing more private universities and indeed it is. Just imagine the savings even if the country saves just US$ 1,000 per year per student, as thousands of Sri Lankan students already study in foreign universities, with more leaving every day. Even more than the financial aspect, local private universities will give the students the option of studying the desired subjects with the advantage of living with their families in a familiar environment.\nQuite apart from saving foreign exchange, private universities can actually help earn foreign exchange by enrolling foreign students. If Sri Lanka has world-class private universities, just like Malaysia, Belarus and Australia, students will be attracted to them especially from Africa and Asia, as food and lodging cost much less here.\nMoreover, private universities are necessarily job-oriented, unlike some State universities which offer courses that have no relevance in the modern world. It is very difficult to get a job by following these courses â€“ indeed, Sri Lanka is perhaps the only country to have a so-called Unemployed Graduates Association. Private universities will also address the problem of studentsâ€™ poor English knowledge and also leave no opportunity for ragging.\nGaining admission to a State University in Sri Lanka is not easy by any means. The Advanced Level examination is very competitive and of the 100,000 who qualify for university admission, only around 30,000 actually enter the universities every year. It is thus a rare privilege. There should be more educational opportunities for the rest. This is another reason why we need private universities.\nWhile private universities and educational institutions offering various courses have gained ground in Sri Lanka without much resistance, there is still a debate over the establishment of private medical universities. However, with the flight of doctors in search of greener pastures and the limited intake of students to State medical colleges, the Government has now decided to establish at least three private medical colleges and several other private universities. This time, the Government must be firm in its stance, without giving into the demands of those who oppose private universities and private medical colleges.\nThis must be established through an Act of Parliament, covered by a National Policy on Education that essentially recognises private universities including private medical colleges. In fact, this is what several of our neighbouring countries have done.\nFor example, in Bangladesh, its Parliament passed the Private University Act of 1992. Now, there are nearly 100 approved private universities in Bangladesh. In India and Nepal too, legal protection is provided to private universities.\nThe main reason for some student organisationsâ€™ agitation against the opening of private investments in university education is the incorrect perception that private universities would harm the present free education system in Sri Lanka.\nIf you look at other countries, this line of thinking is completely wrong. State and private universities complement each other. The competition will be among private universities themselves for the rankings and prestige. The final beneficiaries would be the students. Moreover, State universities will also strive to improve their World University Rankings.\nThe time has come to end the debate on private universities once and for all. The Government should take a firm stand to establish more private universities regardless of the pressure from various quarters. Opposition parties including the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the National Peopleâ€™s Power (NPP) must also clarify their stance on private universities. The abolition of SAITM has cost the country dearly in terms of the number of doctors who would have qualified by now. There must be no room for such short-sighted actions again.\nThe post Let sanity prevail appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Editorial','2024-05-04','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/05/05/editorial/22461/let-sanity-prevail/',NULL);

The result is that we are now excused from having to pay a mountain of debt immediately,&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/opinion/27339/debt-as-friend-or-foe/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debt as friend or foe?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunday Observer</a>.</p>','We are not out of debt, but we have deflected our debt component. The result is that we are now excused from having to pay a mountain of debt immediately, but are also somehow deemed creditworthy which means Fitch and other ratings agencies would grant us the useful nod.\nSo debt, it is seen, has many dimensions. It is one thing to be in debt, another to incur debt, and still entirely a different matter to be deemed creditworthy.\nCreditworthiness is essentially a matter of how astutely a country is able to convince certain creditor nations and others how good they are as a potential borrower nation in the future. International debt is different from, say individuals incurring debt to banks. That variety of debt is not written off.\nCorrection: that variety of debt is rarely written off. There are favoured banking clientele that may get off lightly, and not have to pay massive sums they have borrowed. Countries in our South Asian neighbourhood do not exactly have millionaires and billionaires of the Elon Musk persuasion, by the way. The likes of Musk made their own money, and made enormous wads of it at that.\nSTATE HANDOUTS\nPresidents such as Donald Trump then chased after them to make use of their money and their wisdom, whenever possible. But in countries such as ours, the rich have not quite reached the zenith without generous State handouts by way of debt write-offs by banks. Either that or they have got monopoly State tenders or State contracts that make them rich, because they are given exclusive rights over a certain product or service. So the Elon Musks of this world are rich men who came by wealth by dint of hard work and some innovation, and contributed their fair share to progress. Our Uber rich by contrast got there by virtue of State concessions, and want more.\nBut back to the subject of national debt. This was not a subject up for discussion when the health of the economy was discussed in the 50s or the 60s. There was a time pre-Independence and immediately post-Independence reputedly, when we were a creditor nation and bankrolled Britain when necessary, of course, with Britain being war ravaged and us conveniently being a colony. But nevertheless, national debt never came up as a subject for discussion during those early days.\nBut the debt issue is a subject of national focus now, and depending on the exact circumstances, even a subject of national celebration. When we get a debt reprieve of sorts, we cheer because debt is as stark a reality as night follows day in this country.\nDebt also means that we are internationally connected as a country and are respected, it has been argued. But this is so long as our debt is deemed sustainable and we are not seen as a defaulter, or a bankrupt entity. So, recently, we jumped that hurdle and negotiated our loan repayments fully, we are told.\nCan this be taken to mean that we are a fully globalised nation? (The reasoning being that debt-repaying and creditworthy nations are deemed sufficiently globalised). There will be two sides to this argument. Back here, people overwhelmingly would be naturally somewhat sceptical about such a representation of events. People have seen debt to be malignant during the economic meltdown of 2022.\nThey see that debt repayments have been negotiated now, but overall they cannot be expected to change their minds on the nature of debt, given that they are also aware that all of them and future generations bear the burden of repaying that debt that has been negotiated.\nBut some of the debt has been virtually written off, though vast amounts still have to be paid. Some would see this as signalling that we are increasingly a globalised participant in the economy, being able to meet the vagaries of the commercial debt market. That we are able to negotiate our debt successfully would be taken as further proof that we are a consummate globalised player.\nBut is â€˜playerâ€™ a right word at all, given all of the connotations it has? People who have borne the brunt of the country being saddled in debt and paid the price for default in 2022 by undergoing immense hardships, would be scandalised if not amused if they are told that we are also by the way an international player, and that we are, at the end of the day, a consummate participant in the global economy, debt and all things bundled into the equation.\nMANY FACETS\nYes, there are many facets of debt. But, debt if mismanaged, particularly foreign currency debt, can have harmful effects on economies as we do not have any control over the currencies in which we are supposed to pay back. Several countries are undergoing debt-stress or are in acute severe debt-stress because they are unable to pay back in dollars or Euros, and the fact is they are a debtor and not a player, until this debt is either negotiated or settled in time.\nCreditworthy countries do not have to ponder such issues and you would not hear of this same conversation happening in Singapore, for instance. But countries such as ours can pass from being creditworthy to un-creditworthy in different phases.\nAt present, we are said to be creditworthy or creditworthy in a manner of speaking. We have negotiated our debt, though payments have been also kept in abeyance for the most part. If that makes us a participant in the globalised economy, so be it. It means we would be able to borrow more and that is both a good portend and a terrible portend, considering that we have recently been so bad at managing our debt.\nThe other facet is that debt is so much a part of our internal political dialogue. This is taken to mean that our sovereignty itself is compromised, at least in some interpretations. Some political analysts are of the view that there is no such thing as absolute sovereignty and that if debt impacts sovereignty, it is unfortunate reality and is par for the course, because we are not the only country in debt.\nINTEGRAL PART\nThe problem is that debt has become so much of an integral part in our national conversation that it is overbearing. It is in other words now, central to our discourse. War used to be central to our discourse several years back, but now debt is, though some would qualify that to say it is the economy we are worried about and debt is but a part of it.\nWhichever way we slice that, it is debt that became our problem and so, another facet of debt is that we have learnt to live with it, whether it signifies us as being an international player or not. It couldnâ€™t be stressed enough that being characterised as a â€˜playerâ€™ is small comfort to people whose cost-of-living had skyrocketed due to debt and effects of debt-default. But yet, our national psyche is now conditioned to the fact that we have to deal with debt. There is no cry for instance, from any quarter, to aim to be entirely debt free. Debt is merely considered a necessary evil.\nThat should have been fine if we are progressing, and strictly only if we are progressing in terms of economic development. Such progress is not necessarily dependent on infrastructure upgrades for instance, by making use of foreign debt, though infrastructure development overall is taken to be good, as it improves the quality of life. This is arguable in cases where debt has compromised a nation such as ours so much, that we couldnâ€™t import essentials, as happened in the past. But we are said to be over that now and on a path to progress. But a lot of those assessments would have to be made later, when we see the results while we start repaying our debt substantially. That is another facet of debt.\nDebt becomes a constant companion in our national journey that we find difficult to shake off. We hope to, therefore, be in companionable terms with debt in the long and near term future. Down the road, we expect to always encounter the debt spectre, in its varying and evolving incarnations.\nThe post Debt as friend or foe? appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Opinion','2024-07-06','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/opinion/27339/debt-as-friend-or-foe/','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/8-3.jpg'),(1,_binary 'fŒR—*T‚Å˜w','Debt restructuring and Sri Lankaâ€™s future','<p>An expert discussion was held last Friday (5) at the Government Information Department regarding Sri Lankaâ€™s worst economic collapse since its independence and measures taken to boost the countryâ€™s economy.&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/opinion/27346/debt-restructuring-and-sri-lankas-future/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debt restructuring and Sri Lankaâ€™s future</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunday Observer</a>.</p>','An expert discussion was held last Friday (5) at the Government Information Department regarding Sri Lankaâ€™s worst economic collapse since its independence and measures taken to boost the countryâ€™s economy. The discussion emphasized Sri Lankaâ€™s dire need for an economic transformation and the Government presented the Economic Transformation Act which will make the changes towards this end. It is an essential Bill during this time. The experts also said that a country does not progress by merely presenting a Bill and the new Bill has a broad vision including creating a strong network of institutions and a program to be implemented.\nNo regime can govern for more than two weeks if they exit the IMF process â€“ Minister of Transport, Highways and Mass Media Dr. Bandula Gunawardena\nMy main aim is to raise awareness about the political measures taken regarding the situation. The current account deficit of the State budget and the current account deficit of the balance of payments can be said to be the two worst deficits in the past few decades after independence.\nAs a Cabinet minister, an explanation should be given regarding the action taken to boost Sri Lankaâ€™s economy.\nNo matter who is in charge, the Government of Sri Lanka does not have enough income and receipts to bear the expenses that have to be borne again and again, as a result of the expenses incurred in the daily running of the State. For example, last yearâ€™s audited financial report by the Auditor General explains that the Government spent on government employeesâ€™ salaries, pensions of senior citizens, Samurdhi, Aswasuma, other household subsidies and travel expenses. The amount available is Rs. 4.7 trillion. The amount received by the Treasury from new taxes imposed on everyone, direct taxes, goods taken by everyone regardless of income level, indirect taxes, non-tax income such as profits, dividends, interest, grants, and other deposits is three trillion.\nThe Central Bank has maintained its outstanding Rs. 1.7 trillion with the money received from the weekly Treasury Bill auction. At the time of violent protests, the Government presented a supplementary estimate and paid money by drawing money from the Central Bank, but according to the new law, it has now been banned.\nTo maintain its economy, the country must import consumer goods such as lentils, yams, onions, chillies, intermediate goods such as mineral oil, bulk chemicals and machinery and equipment from the external economy. Without it, people cannot survive. For that purpose, agricultural exports such as tea, rubber, coconuts and industrial exports such as textiles and garments were used to generate income from the export of gems and other minerals, but there is still a deficit in the trade account after 1977. There is not enough income from overseas Sri Lankans or tourism receipts to cover that deficit and the balance of payments; deficit as well as the current account deficit have been affected in all the years except last year.\nTo cover these two deficits, every regime had continuously taken loans. There, concessional loans were taken from the World Bank, and Asian Development Bank, IMF, but when the concessional loans were not enough, when the money was not enough, sovereign bonds were issued in the market and a large loan was taken. Development bonds have been issued. Not being able to pay all of them has officially informed that the loan cannot be paid. Before that, with the assumption of power by President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, he requested the Cabinet to come forward with someone who is capable of recovering the country from this situation.\nWhen faced with collapse, 28 companies that provide advisory expert services came forward and 20 of them were qualified. The Cabinet appointed a sub-committee to decide on who can be entrusted with this responsibility. Prof. GL Peiris, a Cabinet Minister at that time, was appointed as its chairman. The responsibility was assigned to Franceâ€™s Lazard agency and the Clifford Chance firm was appointed with Cabinet approval to provide legal advice and to appear in courts regarding the crises in the financial sector. In the meantime, proposals were made to go to the IMF as the last lender, but due to division in the Cabinet at that time, they could not go together to the IMF. After that, the countryâ€™s economy collapsed and a crisis arose. Then the amount of reserve was short. There were queues.\nThe people were blinded by hatred. Houses of peopleâ€™s representatives were burnt. Eight -hundred houses were destroyed. President Ranil Wickremesinghe accepted the challenge of recovering the country as a leader with political experience as a five-time Prime Minister when the country was in a state of anarchy and he took necessary steps. That is why the debt restructuring agreements were reached.\nNo regime can govern this country for more than two weeks if they leave the IMF process. So-called experts who do not understand this are spouting lies. They are trying to drag this country back to the era of fuel and gas queues and blackouts.\n\nThis is a moment when Sri Lanka is expecting an economic transformation more than ever before- Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe\nThe present can be described as a moment when Sri Lanka is expecting an economic transformation more than ever before. The Government has presented the Economic Transformation Bill, which will make a huge contribution towards fulfilling those expectations. It is the most necessary Bill for the country.\nA country does not progress by merely presenting a Bill, and the new Bill has outlined a broad vision including creating a strong network of institutions and a program to be implemented according to that Bill. All those who worked on it deserve our thanks and respect.\nSo far, we have made great progress in restructuring Sri Lankaâ€™s domestic and foreign debts. It is my duty to make an explanation about it.\nThe first thing to mention here is that it has emerged that it is impossible to pay the Government debt by the year 2020, 2021. In the year 2020, the International Monetary Fund was giving financial grants to any country without conditions during the Covid -19 pandemic.\nAt that time, the International Monetary Fund did not agree to give it to Sri Lanka. The reason is that our country is unable to repay the debt. Our country was unable to get an emergency loan facility due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe reason for this is the continuous decrease in Government revenue. In this context, the Government announced that it has temporarily suspended the payment of the loan taken on April 12, 2020. Government debt, bilateral and multilateral debt and international sovereign debt had to be restructured. One party here is the Sri Lankan government. Those are the borrowers. The other party is the lender. The two groups worked to reach an agreement on debt restructuring, with the International Monetary Fund acting as an arbiter. On March 18, 2022, we reached a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund for the first time to come out of the crisis.\nAccordingly, in the next 10 years, they agreed to work according to many other goals such as reducing Government debt, increasing Government revenue, and increasing export revenue.\nWe are working with the support of the International Monetary Fund and it was a great strength in the journey to make the debt optimally sustainable. First, we optimsed the domestic debt. It was done in September 2023. Here we had to make a small contribution to the debts we had to pay.\nThe second phase will be the restructuring of bilateral foreign debt. It happened on June 26. The Paris Club and India, Japan, France and China agreed to this debt restructuring. There we got more time to repay the debt we owed. The amount of interest decreased. This is our victory. After that, it was possible to restructure the debt with international sovereign bond holders on the July 4. Fifty percent of those creditors agreed with us for this discussion. Based on this agreement, Sri Lanka will have the opportunity to get the most appropriate concessions according to the criteria accepted by the International Monetary Fund and their analysis.\nNothing will be deducted from the funds provided by them during bilateral debt restructuring. The only relief is to increase the loan repayment period or reduce the interest rates.\nIn the restructuring of debt with private creditors, arrangements will be made to provide Sri Lanka with a comparative relief commensurate with the repayment capacity of the debt and the relief obtained in the aforementioned foreign bilateral and multilateral debt restructuring. In determining the concessions we expect from the creditors, we will also deeply analyse and make a decision about the growth that Sri Lanka will achieve economically in the next 5-10 years, and our ability to achieve the targets of increasing government revenues. For this, the agreement of the International Monetary Fund and international official creditors should be obtained.\nAs Sri Lanka begins to advance economically by developing its capacity to pay off debt, efforts will be made to raise the grade given to us by foreign credit rating agencies.\n\nGovt is moving towards a sustainable economic program that wonâ€™t collapse again- Presidential Senior Economic Adviser Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga\nThe debt restructuring program with various creditors has been successfully carried out so far to sustainably repay domestic and foreign loans taken by Sri Lanka. The Government and the authorities worked to achieve this success and the Government has now taken steps to prevent an economic collapse. A very solid program has been prepared and President Ranil Wickremesinghe gave it the needed leadership.\nThe Government presented more than 60 new and amended Ordinances to meet the economic and social development goals. About 30 of them are leading Acts related to economic management. Among these Bills, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act presented on September 15, 2023, the Public Debt Management Act, the Act incorporating new laws on procurement and the Economic Transformation Act take priority.\nThere are mainly four institutions to deal with public debt management. They manage public debt in various ways. But no single institution has been established for this purpose. It has been proposed to set up a single agency under the new Public Debt Management Act to fill this gap.\nIn such an environment, the Economic Transformation Act, which has a very timely and far-sighted vision, has been introduced by the current Government. This Act is a composite Act. There are five Acts in this. As far as I know in the history of Sri Lanka, the Act that was presented in the 1980s which was presented together with three Acts related to the field of vocational training can be called as a composite act. Then you presented five Bills together, one of the Bills that we need to know more about is the Economic Transformation Act.\nSri Lanka has a small economy. Its value is 85 billion US dollars. Our resources are limited. We must work to use this limited amount of resources efficiently and effectively. For that, we need new research and training. The new Economic Transformation Act provides guidelines to achieve these goals. In this Act, more weight has been placed to fulfill three main things aiming to create Government debt sustainability in three main areas.\nSri Lanka currently has 128 percent domestic and foreign debt as a percentage of GDP. It is aimed to reduce it to 95 percent. Currently, the Governmentâ€™s foreign debt as a percentage of GDP is 9.4 percent. It is aimed to reduce it to 4.5 percent.\nNot only this, but the overall gross domestic product has been targeted to grow by more than five percent year on year. It aims to reduce unemployment and increase womenâ€™s labour contribution to economic development. It is aimed to increase it to 25 percent by next year, 40 percent in 2030 and 50 percent in 2040.\nIt is a victory we have achieved. The Economic Transformation Act aims to achieve debt sustainability. Accordingly, a program has been outlined to achieve it. In this way, it is special that not only plans but also a program to implement the new act, which we can introduce as a comprehensive act, is given in the act itself.\nSri Lanka was very poor in the 1950s and 60s. Even at that time, the Governmentâ€™s income as a percentage of the gross domestic product exceeded 20 percent. By the mid-1990s, Sri Lanka had become a middle-income country. In that era too, Government revenue as a percentage of GDP remained at the level of 22 percent and 18 percent. Sri Lanka, which received such a high level of Government income, by the 2020s, the Government income as a percentage of the gross domestic product fell to eight percent, nine percent. At this time, Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP has exceeded 20 percent. In this way, it will be difficult to move a country when the government expenditure is high and the Government revenue is at a low level. Thus, Sri Lanka had become a country with one of the lowest incomes in the world. After getting rid of that situation, we have increased the countryâ€™s income to 10 percent â€“ 11 percent. It is also not enough anymore. Accordingly, we should work to reach the level of 15 percent, 16 percent in the next few years. The goals for them are also stated in the new Act.\nThe Economic Transformation Act aims to overcome two challenges that Sri Lanka has been facing. These goals are to reduce the high budget gap and reduce the foreign trade deficit. To overcome this, export income should be increased. Foreign direct income should be increased. For that we need to use new knowledge. Technology should be integrated. We must do our work efficiently and effectively. For this purpose, a number of existing institutions have been abolished and five new institutions have been established for socio-economic development. Working with the establishment of these five institutions, the welfare and development of the entire people should be achieved through the results of all economic activities.\nThe establishment of the Sri Lanka Economic Commission, the establishment of an institution for the regularisation of Sri Lanka investment zones, the establishment of the institution for the promotion of foreign trade, the establishment of a National Productivity Commission, and the establishment of an intelligence board to take steps to promote international trade. Here, for the National Productivity Commission, every institution will be integrated and efforts will be made to create a situation where the country and the society will benefit from every rupee of investment made by the Government and private individuals. Through this, the Government expects to make Sri Lanka a prosperous and developed country by establishing debt sustainability, regardless of the government under the Economic Transformation Act.\n\nGoals should be based on three things to get rid of the debt crisis- Senior Lecturer, Department of Economics, University of Colombo Prof. Priyanga Dunusinghe\nWe canâ€™t depend on handouts. Instead we should strive to create a developed country with long-term economic growth and sustainable debt repayment capacity. For that, we must take care to create an export-oriented economy.\nToday we are talking about a debt restructuring program. In 2010, a debt restructuring occurred when the world economic crisis emerged. Such things happen even today. 32 percent of countries in the Asian region underwent debt restructuring. The European countries got the concession by 30 percent. Latin American countries received 31 percent. African countries got 47 percent. It is said that we have received 28 percent loan relief so far. But we should not always rely on debt relief. Any country must get rid of its debt to become a developed nation. There should be goals based on three things to get rid of the debt crisis. Countries that achieve such goals will emerge from debt crises.\nForeign direct investment as a percentage of GDP should be at a level of four percent to five percent. Womenâ€™s labour contribution should be at the level of 65 percent to 70 percent. Export of goods and services should be between 65 percent and 70 percent of income. Out of these, our countryâ€™s current export income of goods and services is 21.5 percent. It should be brought closer to 25 percent level and 40 percent level in future.\nWhen it comes to bringing in foreign direct investment or winning new markets, we have a set of goals and programs to achieve. Bribery and corruption should be eliminated. We should reach the level of a developed country in the global anti-corruption index. The ease of doing business index should be brought to the worldâ€™s recognised level. We cannot get out of the crisis just by debt restructuring without following such measures. If we do not act in this way, we will have to take loans from the International Fund and other financial institutions again and again. Ghana, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Greece, which are in debt crisis with us, have done debt restructuring on many occasions to get out of it. However, we should not be prepared to continue following that course. At this time, it is important to learn lessons and work to move forward without falling into the same pit again.\nÂ \nThe post Debt restructuring and Sri Lankaâ€™s future appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Opinion','2024-07-06','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/opinion/27346/debt-restructuring-and-sri-lankas-future/','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/9-2.jpg'),(2,_binary 'fŒR—*T‚Å˜x','Cricket administration needs a complete overhaul â€“ Ali Sabry, PC','<p>After 1996, cricket became a big business : Competent personnel should administer cricket: Voting structure in SL cricket problematic: Sri Lankaâ€™s early exit from the preliminary round of the T20&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/opinion/27312/cricket-administration-needs-a-complete-overhaul-ali-sabry-pc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cricket administration needs a complete overhaul &#8211; Ali Sabry, PC</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunday Observer</a>.</p>','After 1996, cricket became a big business :\nCompetent personnel should administer cricket:\nVoting structure in SL cricket problematic:\nSri Lankaâ€™s early exit from the preliminary round of the T20 World Cup has deeply concerned cricket fans nationwide. The team, which triumphed in the T20 World Cup in 2014, managed only one victory against the Netherlands in this tournament. They suffered losses to South Africa and Bangladesh, and their match against Nepal was cancelled due to rain.\nAs the Sri Lankan team, led by Wanindu Hasaranga, returned home empty-handed, a new Cricket Constitution Bill prepared by a six-member committee chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chitrasiri, was presented to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. This committee was formed based on recommendations from a Cabinet sub-committee set up to address the national cricket teamâ€™s recent setbacks and administrative issues.\nLast year, the Cabinet sub-committee, chaired by Foreign Minister Ali Sabri and including Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara, Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, and Public Security Minister Tiran Alas, submitted a 46-page report with 40 recommendations to the Cabinet. Following this, retired Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chitrasiri was appointed in February to draft a new constitution for Sri Lanka Cricket.\nIn a discussion with the Sunday Observer, Foreign Minister Ali Sabri shared his views on the current decline in Sri Lankan cricket, the recommendations of the Cabinet sub-committee, and the Cricket Reform Committee report.\nQ: The Sri Lankan cricket team was thrown out in the preliminary round of this yearâ€™s T20 World Cup, while even teams such as Afghanistan and America advanced to the Super Eight round. What is your opinion?\nA: Today, cricket has fallen like never before in our cricket history. I am talking about Afghanistanâ€™s victory in the Twenty20 World Cup, and I see it as a reflection of the condition of our cricket before 1996. Afghanistan focused solely on the game and the country, much like the cricket administration in our country at that time. Some individuals genuinely loved the game and dedicated their time and money to cricket: Ana Punchihewa, Raja Mahendran, Daham Wimalasena, N.M. Perera, and Gamini Dissanayake. They worked with great enthusiasm, seeking no personal favours or privileges.\nHowever, after 1996, cricket became a big business. An influx of money came in, with sponsorships and television broadcasting rights. This shift led to a situation where, instead of a passion for cricket, the desire to gain benefits and fame from it took over. A few individuals, with no real fame, are now in control. Often, their decisions do not reflect the wisdom expected. That is why we say our cricket administration needs a complete overhaul.\nQ: The Cricket Reforms Committee was appointed according to the report given by the Cabinet sub-committee chaired by the President to look into the cricket crisis. What has been your committeeâ€™s experience looking into the decline in cricket?\nA: Before calling the Cricket Reforms Committee report, we gained significant experience while collecting facts for the report we completed. We have identified major weaknesses in cricket administration. Competent individuals should administer cricket, and this has two parts. One is the administration of the cricket institute, and the other is the technical aspect of cricket, which can be managed by cricket players and coaches.\nHowever, managing an organisation is akin to managing a company. How will it be audited? How will the procurement process be conducted? How will information be obtained? It requires talented individuals. For instance, a person who worked in a big company has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Therefore, we believe a significant change in administration is necessary, and we have stated this in our report.\nQ: What are the weaknesses of the Sri Lankan cricket industry identified by the Cabinet sub-committee?\nA: We discussed with the cricket players, and one key issue they highlighted is the low quality of our pitches. They said that the ball â€˜cutsâ€™ well on these pitches, but when they go to international tournaments such as the 2023 ODI World Cup, they struggle from the very first ball because the pitches differ.\nThis is a significant problem. Despite this, our cricket administration is investing about one and a half to two billion rupees in the Dambulla stadium to install lights for day-night matches, which havenâ€™t been played there in many years. This investment seems misplaced. Recently, I heard that Rs. 52 million worth of live screens were purchased and given to those who didnâ€™t request them. This reflects a lack of transparency in spending, which, if not addressed, could lead to a further decline in our cricket standards.\nMoreover, the voting structure in Sri Lanka Cricket is problematic. Despite having a population of 22 million, there are 147 votes in the cricket office election compared to countries such as India, Australia, and England, which have far fewer votes. This discrepancy allows resources to be used primarily to win these votes rather than for cricket development. This system discourages talented individuals from participating.\nFor example, Muralidaran said that while he could win votes from the Colombo district, he wouldnâ€™t receive any from the cricket board. This indicates that a separate group is maintaining power, which must change. Significant investment is needed in infrastructure, new pitches, and technical knowledge. Supporting young players transitioning from school is also crucial to ensure they stay in the sport.\nQ: What are the proposals made by the Cabinet Sub-Committee to develop Sri Lanka Cricket?\nA: In my report, I noted that both coaches and players point out each otherâ€™s shortcomings, leading to a lack of harmony. Conversely, our womenâ€™s cricket team, which is very united and respectful towards coach Rumesh Ratnayake, is performing well. This unity and respect contribute to their success. The local cricket structure needs change, as combining the â€˜Aâ€™ and â€˜Bâ€™ sections in tournaments has lowered the standard.\nWe recommend revisiting the report by Aravinda de Silva, Muttiah Muralitharan, Kumar Sangakkara, and Mahela Jayawardene on developing cricket. Their insights are valuable, especially as they coach IPL teams. We suggested gathering a group to review and implement this report. Changes should ensure that cricket administration isnâ€™t dominated by a few individuals who exploit resources for personal gain.\nQ: What are the recommendations made in addition to the suggestions?\nA: Our recommendations include several points, highlighting three Auditor General reports since 2018. These reports state that $100,000 being transferred from Sri Lanka Cricket to an American account, which needs investigation. We also proposed drafting a new constitution through the Cricket Reforms Committee, which should be enacted into law via Parliament. This would limit the number of votes in the cricket body and restrict the cricket committee to 18 members, selected from different fields and sports clubs. These members should include former cricketers, ensuring a balance. A CEO should manage day-to-day operations, selected based on talent through advertisements, similar to practices in Australia and India. Implementing these measures would provide a solid foundation for our cricket administration.\nQ: How long will it take to implement the reports of the Cabinet Sub-Committee and the Cricket Reforms Committee?\nA: This falls under the Minister of Sports, responsible for implementation. Given that the committee included the Attorney Generalâ€™s and Legislation Department members, it shouldnâ€™t take long. If we work collaboratively, the new law could be passed within three weeks to two months after it is gazetted. We can provide a report and recommendations to the Sports Secretary, but the implementation must be monitored.\nQ: Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is an organisation dealing with the International Cricket Council (ICC). Are they saying that it is not a Government-owned institution?\nA: That notion is incorrect. Cricket is a public institution, not a private company created by private investment. It is a Government institution since government schools and their children played cricket, which led to ICC membership. Therefore, cricket belongs to the people of Sri Lanka and should be accountable to them. The current administration has misused resources as personal property, which must be rectified. Cricketâ€™s success should be measured by its inspiration and pride to Sri Lanka, not just the cricket boardâ€™s budget or the number of tournaments held.\nQ: Will the International Cricket Council influence the Governmentâ€™s intervention in the cricket body?\nA: This process cannot be hindered by fear of ICC intervention. The Lodha Committee of India and South Africa, where Government decisions impacted cricket administration, show that such changes are possible. The Prime Minister of Pakistan appoints the Cricket President, but we suggest a clear, independent selection process. A selection committee of independent individuals should choose candidates for the cricket body, ensuring balance and integrity. The selected CEO would handle day-to-day administration, while the committee focuses on policy decisions. This structure, akin to a companyâ€™s management, would address the current issues in Sri Lanka Cricketâ€™s administration.\nThe post Cricket administration needs a complete overhaul â€“ Ali Sabry, PC appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Opinion','2024-07-06','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/opinion/27312/cricket-administration-needs-a-complete-overhaul-ali-sabry-pc/','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4-2.jpg'),(3,_binary 'fŒR˜*T‚Å˜y','UKâ€™s new â€˜smartâ€™ Premier wins mass vote for economic recovery','<p>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland may not seem all that â€œgreatâ€ anymore, especially after leaving the European Union, but its citizens may be optimistic about social&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/opinion/27329/uks-new-smart-premier-wins-mass-vote-for-economic-recovery/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UKâ€™s new â€˜smartâ€™ Premier wins mass vote for economic recovery</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunday Observer</a>.</p>','The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland may not seem all that â€œgreatâ€ anymore, especially after leaving the European Union, but its citizens may be optimistic about social and economic recovery after electing a new Government last week. The Labour Party, that won a â€˜landslideâ€™ election of sorts, offers a stable regime with a strong Parliamentary majority and, a new generation of youngish, â€˜smartâ€™ politicians.\nThis is seen as a refreshing change after more than a decade of hopelessly old-style, even decadent (remember the Covid-19 â€˜partygateâ€™?), governance by the Conservative Party. â€œChangeâ€ was very much part of Labourâ€™s campaign spiel.\nThe Kingdomâ€™s new Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, QC, KCB, is known mainly for his demure style â€“ news media calls him â€œdullâ€ and â€œblandâ€ â€“ but he is an accomplished legal technocrat and activist. His new glamour as his partyâ€™s dramatically successful leader after 14 years out of power, actually complements an already impressive political and professional career of rapid achievements.\nThe 61-year-old Queenâ€™s Counsel has won professional awards for human rights legal activism and a sustained social service of hundreds of pro bono appearances. They include successfully defending scores of death sentence appeals for criminal cases in several Caribbean and African countries of the Commonwealth.\nComplementing his professional career is also Starmerâ€™s service as Director of Public Prosecutions of England and Wales. He also served as an advisor on policing matters in Northern Ireland â€“ that long-sidelined territory that, since 1169, remains Britainâ€™s earliest colony.\nKnight Commander\nIn the 2014 â€˜royal honoursâ€™, Starmer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (of the British â€œEmpireâ€, of course) for â€œservices to law and criminal justiceâ€. This is the youngest of the three orders of chivalry of the UK, after the more exclusive knightly orders of the Garter and the Thistle.\nOn Friday, Sir Kier became the first UK Prime Minister in 61 years who was already a Knight of the Realm on assuming office (since Sir Alec Douglas-Home became Premier as a Knight in 1963). Usually, politicians are knighted at the end of their careers.\nAlthough head of the Left-wing Labour Party and, himself the son of a south London industry technician, Starmer studied in private schools and ended up doing law in Oxford. He met and married his wife while both were practising attorneys in London. They have a teenage son and daughter.\nWhatever their politics, both are quietly fashionable and known for their youthful â€˜chicâ€™. Greater London-born and bred Starmer is known as an â€˜Arsenal fanaticâ€™ (for the inner-city football club).\nIn an interview with Starmer after he became party leader this March, the elitist â€˜Vogueâ€™ magazine drools over the Labour leaderâ€™s very un-working class dress ensembles: â€œhis signature navy suits are all Charles Tyrwhitt, and, when not in leader mode, heâ€™s partial to Adidas trainers and Stone Island polos.â€\nâ€œA sartorial choice that got him called â€œThe New Hooligan in Townâ€ from an approving fanblog,â€ notes an equally approving â€˜Vogueâ€™. And, â€œ..thereâ€™s not a hair out of place on the silver quiff that is so distinctive it has its own Instagram account: @ratingstarmershair.â€ Anglophiles, go to!\nLabour has won the 2024 General Election with a convincing majority of 176. Labour now has 412 of the House of Commons seats and the Conservatives 121.\nOn Friday, Starmer appointed his 25-member Cabinet of Ministers which made history with the highest number of women ministers â€“ 11. They include Rachel Reeves, the UKâ€™s first female Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister), and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.\nThe Cabinet also includes a Black Britisher and also two South Asian Brits. All the Cabinet has solid histories of political experience in previous administrations or shadow cabinets as well as professional experience in different fields.\nCentrist\nMost analysts read Labourâ€™s impressive victory more as a large scale anti-incumbency vote and also an expression of economic desperation by the poorer classes, rather than an ideological shift Leftwards. They note that Starmer today has, himself, significantly shifted towards the Right within his party.\nMost opinion polls had indicated voter disgust over the divisive politics that plagued the Conservative Party regime these past 14 years that saw no less than five Tory governments due to inner party rebellions and six Prime Ministers, some of them in office for just weeks. The number of instances of political betrayals among colleagues in Government that then led to sackings and re-shuffles and, worse, the collapse of regimes, all led to public disillusionment over the Tories fitness to rule.\nAlso upsetting the British public were the number of incidents of decadent Tory life-style, including one Prime Ministerâ€™s in-house office parties during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns when such gatherings were prohibited. Another Prime Minister more recently exited early from the annual war commemoration ceremony in London causing a furore.\nBut what probably was the most decisive factor in the Conservative downfall was the systematic whittling away of the UKâ€™s long-prized social welfare system degrading both good health care and, good education and skills training. Many people had begun comparing the UK in recent years to conditions of a Third World country rather than that of the First World.\nThere is much expectation, especially among the mass of British poor, of some roll-back of the Conservative regimeâ€™s drastic reduction of state subsidised social facilities like public health, public education, public transport, and public housing. Labour has indeed promised such a roll-back of the old Thatcherite Neo-liberalism that is seen as heartless and socially insensitive and potentially risking long term social instability.\nSignificantly, the new Cabinet indicates a careful mix of the Left and Right within the Labour hierarchy. Analysts see the mix as indicative of a very centrist foreign policy. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on addressing domestic devolution issues with the new ministers for Wales and Northern Ireland both known for their political competence in their respective areas.\nAt the same time, there is not likely to be any significant change in the UKâ€™s engagement with the EU with the relevant ministers known for not favouring any re-joining of the Union.\nThe UK is clearly also set to continue with its hawkishly anti-Russian stance on the Ukraine war while sustaining its current hardline support for Israelâ€™s genocidal war and systematic colonising of the land of Palestine. If London cannot even reconsider its 800-year colonial occupation of Northern Ireland, how can the world expect any redress of the UKâ€™s deliberate backing for the European Jewish colonisation of Palestine?\nHow much London will shift in its stance of following Washington in its approach to China also remains to be seen.\nMeanwhile, a newly elected regime also begins its term in Tehran after Fridayâ€™s run-off vote contest between a very conservative, long time administration bureaucrat and, a moderate reform-oriented legislator and medical professional. The reformist is Masoud Pezeshkian, the sole moderate in the original field of four candidates, and, his rival was one-time hardline nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.\nMany in the West â€“ and expansionist Israel â€“ would have preferred Jalili in power so that the West could more easily continue to demonise the currently most assertive West Asian power that is seen as the principal obstacle to the Westâ€™s dominance over the energy-rich region. Jalili is also very close the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iranâ€™s most powerful and regionally most influential military force.\nBut the Iranian people, although considerably disillusioned with the overall Islamic republican set-up, have voted wisely. Firstly, the more progressive, liberal-minded, citizenry, responded to the call by reformists to actively vote in the run-off poll. And they have pushed through their democratic decision.\nMasoud Pezeshkian has won. The countryâ€™s Interior Ministry yesterday announced: â€œBy gaining majority of the votes cast on Friday, Pezeshkian has become Iranâ€™s next president.â€\nThe vote count announced by the Ministry put Pezeshkian as the winner with 16.3 million votes to Jaliliâ€™s 13.5 million.\nNews media reported that Pezeshkianâ€™s supporters had crowded the streets of Tehran and other cities before dawn yesterday (Saturday) to celebrate the victory. This belies the claims by Western news media of political apathy among Iranians.\nVoter participation in the run-off came close 50 percent after much public appeals to voters led by the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameini himself. The run-off on Friday followed a June 28 first round vote with historically low turnout.\nApparently, over 60 percent of Iranian voters abstained from the June 28 snap poll called to elect a successor to President Ebrahim Raisi, who died suddenly in a helicopter crash.\nReform\nWhile some western media painted the newly elected President as being â€œpro-Westâ€, a deeper understanding of current Iranian politics indicates differently.\nAll four original contestants in the snap election â€“ just like the late President Raisi â€“ were staunch supporters of the Islamic Republic. They would not have been approved as candidates if they had not been so, given Iranâ€™s tightly controlled electoral candidatesâ€™ vetting process.\nWhat this means is that the â€˜reformâ€™ dimension is about domestic change, especially in the space for citizens to play more active roles in society and polity both at local and national level.\nAt the same time, the appointment of a technocrat like Pezeshkian will certainly enable a more meticulous management of the economy and administration. Iran is being battered by the harsh sanctions regime imposed and enforced by the Western power bloc and, strenuous and creative efforts are needed to cope with the crippling effects.\nFortunately, the new global geopolitical shifts, with the emergence of new powers in the Global South, provide some useful networks of economic and political support for Iran and other victims of Western big power bullying.\nIn this light, most analysts do not see any serious change in Iranâ€™s foreign policy under President Pezeshkian.\nThe post UKâ€™s new â€˜smartâ€™ Premier wins mass vote for economic recovery appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Opinion','2024-07-06','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/opinion/27329/uks-new-smart-premier-wins-mass-vote-for-economic-recovery/','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tag-SO-World-Sub-continent.jpg'),(4,_binary 'fŒR˜*T‚Å˜z','Holy and unholy alliances','<p>Creativity in a democracy may be when disparate political parties get together.

The clichÃ©, of course, is that politics is the art of the possible.\nIf there are no opposing political groups there is a one party State. There could be one-party systems in fully functioning democracies. If one party consistently keeps winning elections, there is a de facto one party State. But a party system that has a multiplicity of parties that get together and then fall out at the slightest provocation, is called a democracy of hung Parliaments. No, of course, there is no official terminology of that sort. But once upon a time, Sri Lanka, or then Ceylon, did have a democracy of that sort.\nThe fall of the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Government of 1960 was as a result of a defeat in Parliament over the Press Bill. The Federal Party was able to throw its support with Dudley Senanayake and the UNP to form a Government after the 1965 election, with Phillip Gunawardena of the MEP also offering Senanayake a prop under these circumstances.\nSince then, no true creative coalition politics of any significance occurred, even though there was political instability under the stewardship of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga who was unable on occasion to hold onto her coalitionâ€™s Parliamentary majority. In the early 2000s, this resulted in elections, and the formation of a Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, but that Government was short lived too.\nStranger\nWhat would happen if there was an occasion for the creative coalition type of politics that occurred in the 60s were to be re-enacted? Such a situation would be far-fetched, political analysts would say.\nBut yet, that does not prevent us from exploring the eventuality. There have been several theories broached already. There has been talk, for instance, about a grand coalition between the United National Party (UNP), the Pohottuwa (Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna) and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) led by Sajith Premadasa.\nThis is improbable and far-fetched, but having said that at least as possible political reality, Sri Lanka may have never been closer to such an arrangement between the two most powerful conventional (bourgeois?) political parties joining forces to blunt the momentum of the allegedly socialist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).\nTheoretically, there have been similarly improbable political coalitions before. Philip Gunawardenaâ€™s Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) throwing its lot with the so-called bourgeois forces of Dudley Senanayake in 1965 would have been one example. The JVP joining forces with the Chandrika Kumaratunga Government and keeping the latter under probation, literally, was also a good example of improbable politics of convenience. However, a creative coalition of the type some persons are speaking of, between the UNP, SJB and the Pohottuwa would be a political first by far. It is at the point of writing a very remote possibility. However, stranger things have happened in politics â€” at least in other countries â€” that such an eventuality coming to pass can never be completely discounted.\nIn Greenland recently, two fiercely opposed political parties came together to form a coalition Government. A smaller but somewhat formidable political party had formed a coalition Government with one of the main political parties, but the smaller party incurred the displeasure of the two larger parties by taking up the position that only indigenous (Inuit) people should be allowed to vote in any Referendum for independence from Denmark.\nThe electorate â€” or at least the larger parties â€” seemed to be scandalised. This resulted in the two main conventional parties coming together to form a Government (if you need a comparison, think SJB and SLPP or Pohottuwa combining in a coalition.)\nRecently, National Peopleâ€™s Power (NPP) heavyweight Tilvin Silva said this is exactly what is going to happen, because the two main political parties are running scared of being swamped by the JVP or the JVP-led NPP, and would join forces.\nThere is no sign of this happening in reality. But yet, if anything out of the ordinary is going to happen this election season, a JVP-SLPP coalition is far more likely than a JVP-SJB coalition, for instance. An ITAK-JVP coalition or ITAK-SLPP coalition are unlikely eventualities as well.\nCoalition politics could be creative, and at times, strange bedfellows are made when seemingly cherished values and conventions are under threat. This is why the two major parties that are avowed rivals came together to form a Government in Greenland. Greenlanders did not want a â€˜radicalâ€™ party that made Greenland independence exclusively dependent upon Inuit voters to dictate terms.\nMembers of these two large parties saw benefits in being tied to Denmark, a larger nation with greater economic clout than Greenland. When a smaller coalition partner threatened the present orthodoxy, the major parties said enough is enough and promptly joined forces.\nWill the JVPâ€™s apparent front-runner status â€” â€œfront-runnerâ€ according to Tilvin Silva at least â€” result in the SJB, and the SLPP coming together after elections, as opposed to pre-election, in a totally creative coalition?\nTo repeat, as things stand, there is no likelihood of this happening either before or after elections. But analysts believe that todayâ€™s particular arraying of political forces would, if general elections are held first, make way for a hung Parliament.\nIf there is such an outcome, along with the possibility of a formidable JVP in opposition or indeed in Government, would the two major parties close ranks after elections in a political first, and combine their forces?\nFor clarity, for older readers at least, who may find it difficult to keep up with the quicksilver political transformations of our time, this would be like J.R. Jayewardeneâ€™s UNP coming together with Sirimavo Bandarnaikeâ€™s Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to form a Government. Or it would be as if Dudley Senanayake and SWRD Bandaranaike combined forces to create a joint administration after the 1965 election. To say something of that sort would have been unthinkable in those polarised times, is an understatement.\nIf any of these things happened, however, in the 60s or the 70s, it would have signalled a tectonic political shift. The scribes at the then Lake House would have been at a loss to think of what to write, because they were too used to being referred to as the â€˜forces of reactionâ€™ against the progressive forces of Sirimavo Bandaranaike and the Left consisting of the Sama Samajists and the Communists.\nA great many political analysts today feel the JVP factor is overrated. But yet, opinion is divided on that. The conventional political parties represented in the main by the SJB and the Pohottuwa forces and the UNP would likely react to reality, if the JVP does form a Government. It would be to them, as if the JVP had run away with their clothes.\nThat none of this is likely does not stop us journalists from responding to various angles that are being considered by the so-called experts. Some may feel it is exactly the right time for creative coalitions and hung Parliaments because in their view, massive Parliamentary majorities have had overbearing effects on Parliamentary democracy as a force for good.\nNationalist\nHung Parliaments would give room for the cunning to manoeuvre and keep political disruptors at bay, they would feel, but often hung Parliaments do no such thing, and merely foster political instability resulting in chaos and uncertainty. But if a hung Parliament becomes a reality, it would probably be by design rather than purely by accident. In the current conjuncture, it would be useful for certain political forces to seek alliances. Those whom they seek alliances with, however, may not reciprocate.\nBut the latter may change their minds if it somehow becomes clear that improbable alliances would be to their advantage. The Federal Party played this game in the 50 and 60s and their alliance with Dudley Senanayake was seen as a way of staving off Sinhala nationalist forces.\nBut in fact it was Mrs. Bandaranaike who was the expert in strategically using the political ambitions of the then parties of the Left, to her advantage. The Left ideologue N. Shanmugathasan wrote the following about how Mrs. Bandaranaike plotted to break a massive United Left Front (ULF) strike â€˜from within.â€™\nHe describes how Mrs. Bandaranaike summoned the Left leadership for talks: â€˜Even before the beckoning finger of Mrs. Bandaranaike had ceased to move, both N. M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena collided inside Temple Trees through different doors, while poor Peter Keuneman was left at the gate, begging for admission.â€™\nThe long and the short of it was that Mrs. Bandaranaike was able to manoeuvre the founders of the ULF into planting the seeds of its own destruction. As they say, she played it like a fiddle. Could the strategists of today do anything remotely similar when there is great confusion about the future of party politics, and the political allegiances of the day?\nThe post Holy and unholy alliances appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Opinion','2024-06-29','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/30/opinion/26697/holy-and-unholy-alliances/','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/8-2.jpg'),(5,_binary 'fŒR˜*T‚Å˜{','Ranilâ€™s poster, address to the nation and candidacy at Presidential polls','<p>It seems that some people have already forgotten the pressure and difficulties faced by the people when Sri Lanka had gone through the worst ever economic crisis just two years&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/30/opinion/26704/ranils-poster-address-to-the-nation-and-candidacy-at-presidential-polls/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ranilâ€™s poster, address to the nation and candidacy at Presidential polls</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunday Observer</a>.</p>','It seems that some people have already forgotten the pressure and difficulties faced by the people when Sri Lanka had gone through the worst ever economic crisis just two years ago. Some people have hopes to defeat their strongest opponent and gain victory by spreading falsehoods, hatred and malice. Therefore, these days, many reports, statements and posts related to politics on social media are published aiming at distorting the real ground situation. It seems that they think that the political ideologies of the country should be determined through that.\nThe unveiling of the poster titled Aranchiya Subhai (Await! Good news) can be described as an event that gives an understanding of how the media should be handled in such a situation. Some media activists say that this poster has attracted more people than the famous poster Mekaudaâ€¦ Monawada Karanne (Who is this, what is he doing). The poster â€œWho is this and what is he doingâ€ was published only as a poster in those pre-Internet days while the Aranchiya Subhai poster has become a poster as well as a post that has been repeatedly posted and shared many times on social media networks.\nToday, that poster has become one of the most used among many people. Aranchiya Subhai is now being used a lot on social media when referring to anything new. Now it is being used in some advertisements and products as well. This is the best example to show how a creative way was used to announce the successful completion of the countryâ€™s debt restructuring. It has immediately gained the attention of the entire country.\nGood news\nIt was recently shown that some people have forgotten about the harsh experiences that they faced during the economic crisis, but for a large number of people, those bitter memories will not fade away. Knowing that the country is getting out of bankruptcy, the people welcomed the good news by lighting firecrackers. I think that the light that was lit from all directions of the country that day was a symbol of the happiness of the people.\nAt the same time, President Ranil Wickremesingheâ€™s speech to the nation on June 26 seems to have provided an opportunity for the people to have confidence in the countryâ€™s future. It seems that the speech created a different atmosphere for the people who think that they are in a country where they cannot fulfil their dreams, as well as for the people who think that they cannot deal with the future with confidence. In his speech, President Wickremesinghe said that an atmosphere has now been created where the country can escape from bankruptcy and fulfil the expectations of the countryâ€™s youth. While announcing the successful completion of the countryâ€™s debt restructuring, the President also let the public know that he is contesting the forthcoming Presidential Election (PE). Explaining the efforts that he has taken in rebuilding the country and its economy in his address to the nation he said, â€œThey are walking all over Sri Lanka asking for power. They go to schools and ask for power. They are travelling around the world and asking for power and working day and night for power.â€\nâ€œI work day and night for the country, walking all over Sri Lanka and fulfilling the needs of the people and launching programs to strengthen the economy. I am going around the world and working to get international support to develop our countryâ€.\nThen he let the people know that he would run for the PE, leaving the responsibility of deciding on it to the people of this country.\nâ€œWill you join me, who has taken the country forward by understanding the problem from the beginning and giving practical solutions to those issues and also who has shown results or join the groups that still do not understand the countryâ€™s problems and groping in the dark but striving hard for power?â€, he said.\nWhen the other Presidential candidates announced their candidacy and walked all over the country asking for power, President Wickremesinghe said he had taken all efforts to get the country out of darkness and there was a room for people to have a choice between him and them. Until that dayâ€™s indication, President Wickremesinghe had not announced whether he would contest the Presidential Election. He was not ready to announce his candidacy for the PE or start campaigning for it saying as there was enough time for it. In a marathon, there is no advantage for a runner to run at his maximum speed from the very beginning. His strategy seems to have been to exert maximum energy when he is close to the end line of the race while other candidates, who run fast from the start, seem exhausted before the final lap of the race.\nSeasoned politician\nPresident Wickremesinghe, who is a matured and seasoned politician, has an excellent knowledge and experience on elections, including PEs, how the election campaigns should be conducted, and measures to be taken while having experience of winning as well as losing elections. It seems as if he started his Presidential campaign with one poster that is sweeping the entire country.\nAfter releasing the Aranchiya Subhai poster and the Presidentâ€™s address to the nation, no one is now saying that he will not contest the PE. All the claims made by some that he will not contest the PE have now come to an end. He has been able to suppress the campaigns of all other parties with one poster in a sudden and surprising move and create a situation where all the campaigns of others are shaped according to his own campaign.\nDuring those days, other Presidential candidates were vociferous claiming that President Wickremesinghe was going to make a ruse by addressing the nation on June 26. Those parties declared that what he was going to say about debt restructuring is a false propaganda campaign that is going to be started with the aim of deceiving the people. Nevertheless, the real situation was confirmed by the statements of foreign diplomats as well as foreign countries and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Senior Mission Chief in Sri Lanka Peter Breuer before and after the Presidentâ€™s statement.\nUS Ambassador Julie J. Chung has congratulated Sri Lanka on the outcome of the debt restructuring process. India has sent a detailed greeting and expressed that it will continue to support Sri Lanka in the same way it supported Sri Lanka during the economic crisis and appreciated the successful completion of the debt restructuring. At the same time, Japan had also issued a statement and IMF Senior Mission Chief Breuer issued a statement that the countryâ€™s economy has started a successful journey due to Sri Lanka being able to implement debt restructuring at a successful level. Due to such strong statements, it became clear that it is not the kind of deception that the Opposition claims.\nWhat I see as the most important thing is to observe the changes in the PE race after President Wickremesinghe indicated his candidacy and it clearly shows that there are three prominent candidates running for the PE. One change is the way in which the other two parties reacted with panic and confusion after the indication of candidacy by President Wickremesinghe. I think that people see how a big propaganda campaign was launched against President Wickremesingheâ€™s poster and address to the nation, forgetting all other matters.\nThe other is to observe how the politics of the country has completely turned upside down in a sudden move and the course of politics has undergone a great change. Mostly, it is reflected in relation to social media. It would appear that the campaigns of both the other major candidates, which were run with great enthusiasm up to now, have suffered a major setback.

One agreement has been signed with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) of the Paris Club and the other with China. This will give the country extra time to repay the debt.\nAlso, a debt repayment grace period is available through restructuring. According to the Presidentâ€™s announcement, through debt restructuring, Sri Lankaâ€™s debt load, i.e. nine percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) required in relation to repayments, is expected. Efforts will be made to reduce it from nine to 4.5 percent in relation to the 2027-2032 period. Also the gross financial requirement has been reduced by 13 percent in relation to these periods, i.e. in relation to 2027 to 2032 period. These debt restructurings are expected to achieve these goals related to debt sustainability.\nRestructuring of bilateral debt is very important and it can be considered a victory. It can be analysed on several points. The first point is that Sri Lankaâ€™s name was seriously tarnished internationally with the debt default. The reason for that serious scar is because Sri Lanka has never defaulted on debt in its history before 2022.\nExporters, importers and investors faced various problems and difficulties. Through the restructuring of this debt, we can expect to rebuild the image as well as improve the situation. Secondly, especially with debt restructuring, all foreign projects that were currently being implemented with the assistance of bilateral creditors were suspended due to loan defaults.\nIn practice, if a certain type of country defaults on its debt, all development projects are put on pause. The same situation happened in Sri Lanka. The Central Expressway, the BIA expansion project and various other projects were stalled. With the completion of the debt restructuring, the development projects are expected to resume very soon as per the agreements. Even creditor nations are expecting these development schemes to resume as soon as the debt restructuring is done.\nEconomic recovery\nA positive impact on the economic development and a positive impact on security can be expected in starting the development projects that had been halted along the way. To create a good economic outlook, to create credibility for foreign and local investors, for the entire people, some credibility will be created in the gradual occurrence of economic recovery. The chances of a country becoming nationally bankrupt and facing various shocks may increase in the future. In the history of the world, especially when the economy of Latin American countries recovered, there have been external shocks.\nFor example, if an epidemic such as the current bird flu spreads, the tourism industry around the world may collapse. Foreign currencies may collapse and lead to an economic crisis again. In the event of such an economic crisis, if we did not have the IMF, no other country would be able to help us. Due to debt restructuring, if we face any kind of shock now, we will be able to get some assistance in such a case. There was great uncertainty and challenge in the delay in not restructuring the debt.\nDebt restructuring has led to a reduction in exposure to risk and the possibility of a repeat economic crisis. Restructuring with bilateral creditors is mandatory. It is also necessary to ink agreements with the International Sovereign Bond (ISB) holders very soon. This will help complete the debt restructuring process to meet IMF conditions. The end result is that the positive situation needed to reset the economy is created.\nThe money from this restructuring will have to be paid by the year 2028. We should prepare for that. To ensure loan payments, we need to increase export earnings. In the coming period, our economy will have to bear a lesser burden than it has before. As a country we are entitled to a grace period to repay the debt. Giving that extra time means paying a less amount as a premium. We need to create the ability to repay the debt. Gradually we will be able to pay the debt through economic development. Debt sustainability is evident in the study.\nWe need to push our economy into the export sector as much as possible. Even if our existing economy is maintained to this extent and the economic growth is maintained at four to five percent, we will surely get the ability to pay the debt. As the loan instalment has been reduced, it is possible to pay the loan more than the requirement.\nTo maintain a continuous level of economic growth, necessary measures to promote exports should be expanded to promote local investments. We are given room to breathe. There we should breathe properly and all parties should work to build the countryâ€™s economy. As a country, we will not make a debt payment during that period, including the year 2028; a moratorium â€“ a temporary period that allows the lender to stop making payments for a specified period of time. There it works through several methods.\nThere are some cases where the loan is unpaid and interest is not paid. There are also cases where the portion of the loan is paid and the interest is paid. Although it is not clear what has been given here, the debt burden of this country will decrease. More importantly, debt repayment has been eased from nine percent to 4.5 percent of GDP with debt-related restructuring.\nOf the US$ 14 billion commercial loans, there is another US$ 12 billion. Negotiations are ongoing with respect to the bond holders. In debt restructuring, the debt of ISB holders is usually restructured after the debt from bilateral sources is restructured. Once bilateral debts are restructured, the debt restructuring process of bondholders can be completed easily. Therefore, we must promote the export sector and the foreign investment sector.\nThe Governmentâ€™s targets are set out in the Economic Transformation Act. We need to implement development programs and policies to increase exports of goods and services to 25 percent of the GDP in 2025 and gradually to 40 percent in 2030, and to bring foreign investments to a level of five percent as a percentage of the GDP. We should use this relief given to us to positively create a revival in the economy. Especially exports should be promoted. Without that, we cannot expect the countryâ€™s economy to grow.\nBy 2025, the export of goods and services as a percentage of the GDP is to grow to 25 percent and it is basically intended to grow to 40 percent by 2030. The Government has already prepared plans towards an export-oriented economy. It is a constructive process. Changes are taking place in a related structure within the Governmentâ€™s development program to promote foreign investments and market Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Accordingly, organisations such as the Enterprise Sri Lanka have been established and efforts are being made to promote foreign investment.\nExport development\nThe Government hopes to develop identified export promotion sectors to promote the effectiveness of the Bureau to establish an agency for international trade. It is necessary not only to initiate but also to operate all these institutions. Any Government that comes to power in the future should pay attention to this matter. Export development should be done urgently. The matters of foreign investment promotion and trade must be followed. For that, the foundation must be prepared by now.\nWith the IMF today we have reached financial stabilisation and debt restructuring has started. In the future, many deep reforms will have to be done. We must continue these reforms. If adverse decisions are taken for the sake of gaining political power, if there is opposition to these reforms, it is very clear what the final result of that opposition will be. This ongoing economic reform may be disrupted. For example, if the leadership of a different political party is chosen, the progress of economic reforms may be hindered. It is a big challenge and it will cause the biggest obstacle to the economic stability of Sri Lanka in the future.\nCare should be taken to ensure that these reforms are not affected by any upcoming political changes. These essential economic reforms should be implemented in the country, regardless of which political parties gain power. We can no longer go to these welfarist economic reforms. This economy cannot be built on subsidies. All political parties should understand this.\nIn the future, welfarist populist political promises cannot be implemented. Even though they make promises to get into power, as a country, we should think clearly and realistically and make short-term painful decisions that benefit the country in the long run. The leadership should also not hesitate to take painful decisions.\nIf there is any hope to develop the country, welfare economic reforms cannot continue. In the future, we must overthrow the system of maintaining a group of people who benefit from the tax money of hardworking citizens. We need to get out of the subsidy mentality. Instead of maintaining a group who live on welfare we should create an environment that benefits those who do honest labour.\nThere are politicians who use the economy for political gains by perpetuating the welfare system as means of gaining power. If we build a society of hardworking citizens, this country will be able to develop again. If not, we may end up in a crisis again and again. This is a clear victory, and to sustain that victory, the people must work hard and line up to build the country.\nTranslated by Jonathan Frank\nThe post IMF process cannot be halted or altered appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Opinion','2024-06-29','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/30/opinion/26708/imf-process-cannot-be-halted-or-altered/',NULL),(7,_binary 'fŒR™*T‚Å˜}','IMF pact: Major changes not possible â€“ Ali Sabry, PC','<p>Govt winning trust of international community: RCEP membership, more Free Trade pacts mulled : Elections will be held on time: In an exclusive interview with the Sunday Observer, Minister of&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/30/opinion/26679/imf-pact-major-changes-not-possible-ali-sabry-pc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMF pact: Major changes not possible &#8211; Ali Sabry, PC</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunday Observer</a>.</p>','Govt winning trust of international community:\nRCEP membership, more Free Trade pacts mulled :\nElections will be held on time:\nIn an exclusive interview with the Sunday Observer, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Presidentâ€™s Counsel Ali Sabry shares insights into Sri Lankaâ€™s evolving diplomatic relations, economic strategies, and internal challenges. Minister Sabri discusses the Governmentâ€™s proactive engagement with the Muslim world, pivotal bilateral relations with India, efforts to avoid geopolitical entanglements, and the countryâ€™s participation in regional economic partnerships.\nQ: As the Foreign Minister, do you think the Government and the President are winning the trust of the Muslim world by expressing regret over Muslim burials and also the stand on the Gaza War?\nA: Yes, I believe so. Since President Wickremesinghe took office, we have adopted a very proactive approach to engaging with the Muslim world. I have been travelling extensively, and Foreign Ministers from that region have also been visiting Sri Lanka frequently.\nWe have taken principled stands on the Gaza matter, both at the UN and elsewhere, which has earned us significant respect in the international Muslim community. Recently, I met the Foreign Minister of Palestine, who expressed profound gratitude for our consistent position.\nRegarding the burials, the decision to prohibit them at that time was a grave mistake. Unfortunately, it happened, but all we can do now is express our regret and apologise to the Muslims and the affected families. It wasnâ€™t only Muslims who were impacted; some Buddhists who wished to bury their loved ones were also denied. To prevent such issues in the future, we are introducing a new law that will grant people the right to choose either burial or cremation, unless the WHO advises otherwise for specific reasons.\nOverall, internationally, we are gaining the trust of the Muslim community. As for the Muslim community in Sri Lanka, whether we are winning their trust remains to be seen. However, they do appreciate the Presidentâ€™s multi-ethnic approach, where he treats all Sri Lankans as equals and does not single out any particular segment.\nQ: It is significant that Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankarâ€™s first foreign visit was to Sri Lanka after being sworn in. What were the significant highlights of this visit?\nA: There were several highlights of Dr. Jaishankarâ€™s visit. The most notable was the support extended by India during Sri Lankaâ€™s economic crisis. The close to four billion dollars in credit lines provided by India was crucial; without this support, Sri Lankaâ€™s economy could have collapsed beyond repair. This visit reaffirmed Indiaâ€™s continuous support for Sri Lanka and enhanced our business partnerships.\nWe reviewed numerous joint projects, including a dedicated Free Trade Zone in Trincomalee and collaboration on educational initiatives with the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIT) in Chennai. We also discussed potential opportunities in the renewable energy sector.\nThe visit emphasized two key points: first, our desire to strengthen the economic partnership between our countries; and second, the significance of Dr. Jaishankar choosing Sri Lanka for his first official visit as External Affairs Minister during this period. This underscores the importance India places on its relationship with Sri Lanka, which is very gratifying for us. We discussed the possibility of a high-level visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the near future.\nQ: What is the Government doing to avoid getting entangled in any geopolitical conflicts in the Indian Ocean Region, especially through its IORA Chairmanship?\nA: We have made it very clear that we are not aligned with any particular camp. We are an independent country and will continue to uphold this stance. Our basic principle and vision are â€œfriendship with all and enmity to none.â€ We are reaching out to everyone globally.\nIt is very important for us to avoid tensions or superpower rivalries at our doorstep, whether in the Indian Ocean or in our airspace. To achieve this, we have explicitly said that we are not interested in providing military bases for any country. However, we are open to conducting business with everyone. By consistently taking issue-based positions, we believe we have earned the support of the international community.\nQ: With SAARC almost dormant, is Sri Lanka pivoting more towards BIMSTEC and Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA)?\nA: IORA is indeed very active, especially under our chairmanship. We have been undertaking numerous projects almost every month, and this has been very effective. Last year, we hosted the IORA Ministersâ€™ Meeting and the IORA Day celebration. We also conducted sectoral dialogues on maritime security and cruise tourism. Just last week, we held a Business Council meeting in Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Colombo Chamber of Commerce. We are continuously working towards strengthening our engagement with IORA.\nRegarding SAARC, it is in a challenging situation due to well-known reasons. While we are keen to see SAARC become more active, it remains in a difficult position. Recently, the SAARC Director General visited Sri Lanka for discussions, and there is a significant amount of work happening at the official level. However, it has yet to progress to the Foreign Minister or summit levels. Until our major neighbours, India and Pakistan, resolve their differences, it may take longer than anticipated for SAARC to become fully operational again. This situation represents a lost opportunity for all countries in the region.\nQ: What is the progress with regard to joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and having more Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with countries in the region?\nA: The idea behind joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and securing more FTAs is essentially twofold. Firstly, no one is going to invest solely based on the Sri Lankan market, which comprises just 22 million people â€“ not a huge market for attracting significant investment.\nTo address this, we aim to position Sri Lanka as a regional hub, serving a larger market. We can achieve this by establishing FTAs, thereby creating an artificially larger market that is ten or even 100 times bigger than our own. This strategy has been successful for countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. By following this approach, we can attract foreign capital and investment, which is crucial for our economic growth, along with technology transfer.\nRegarding the RCEP, we have applied for membership and are following the set criteria and procedures. We anticipate visits from the Foreign Ministers of Malaysia and Indonesia in August, and we will continue our discussions with them. We are very keen on this.\nIn terms of FTAs, we have made significant progress. We have signed FTAs with Bangladesh and Thailand and are currently negotiating with Malaysia, Indonesia, China, and India for more comprehensive agreements. It is essential to approach this carefully to avoid overexposing our market and to ensure that any agreement results in a win-win situation for all parties involved.\nQ: At a diplomatic level, what is the level of success with talks on debt structuring with creditor countries and International Sovereign Bond (ISB) holders?\nA: Sri Lanka has reached the final agreement on debt restructuring between Sri Lanka and the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) on the sidelines of the Paris Forum 2024 in Paris, France. This will facilitate the restructuring of our debt with foreign creditor countries.\nWith this agreement, instead of suspending payments, we will secure a postponement of payments and resume paying interest and other dues. This is a significant development for Sri Lanka.\nSri Lanka is on track to be one of the fastest countries to emerge from bankruptcy. For instance, Greece, despite being a European Union (EU) country, took about 11 years to come out of bankruptcy. If we can achieve this faster, it will be a remarkable accomplishment for us.\nQ: Several Western countries are still alleging that Sri Lanka engaged in genocide while seemingly ignoring Israelâ€™s actions in the Gaza War. What is your view on this?\nA: The situation can largely be attributed to domestic politics in many Western capitals, where pockets of diaspora votes exert pressure on their MPs, who in turn influence their Governments or ruling parties. This phenomenon is likely to persist for some time.\nWe in Sri Lanka must continue to uphold internal accountability mechanisms. However, the double standards of the West are very evident. The way they address different conflicts, whether in Ukraine or Gaza, is clear for all to see.\nWho provides the diplomatic cover, arms, and ammunition that enable the slaughter of innocent, unarmed civilians, particularly women and children, in Gaza? The death toll there has now exceeded 37,000, yet there is no tangible action being taken. Every time the Security Council or UN proposes a resolution, it is often vetoed or blocked.\nThis double standard is particularly difficult to understand when it comes to Sri Lanka. According to our Constitution, we treat all our people as equals. In any conflict, there will unfortunately be collateral damage, but we fought not against a minority group but against terrorism, and we united our people.\nWe provided food and immunity to those affected by the conflict, and we have released 94 percent of the land occupied during the height of the war. Today, you can see students from previously war-torn areas such as Mullativu and Kilinochchi entering medical faculties, which demonstrates that Sri Lanka treats all its people with respect and dignity.\nQ: Can the Presidentâ€™s term be extended by a referendum or by other legal provisions? What is your view?\nA: Technically, extending the Presidentâ€™s term requires amending the Constitution with a two-thirds majority in Parliament, followed by a referendum.\nI donâ€™t think itâ€™s feasible, and even if it were, it shouldnâ€™t be done. The people must endorse and give the power to carry out reforms to whoever is in office. I believe the President has done enough to go before the people and lay a strong claim for another term, given the significant improvements from two years ago to today.\nPeople may express various personal opinions, but the President himself and the Government are not interested in postponing any elections, particularly the Presidential Election (PE). It will be held as per the Constitution.\nQ: Who will you be supporting at the PE and would you back a Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) candidate if it were a choice between President Wickremesinghe and SLPP?\nA: We have to wait and see how things unfold. Personally, I feel that President Ranil deserves another term for the betterment of the country. These economic reforms are challenging and require foresight and knowledge to implement effectively. I do not see anyone else who could accomplish what he has done.\nInternationally, he has gained many supporters and admirers in multilateral organisations such as the UN, World Bank, and IMF. He has also garnered support from the international community, including both Eastern and Western countries. I believe it would be beneficial for the country if he could remain in power for another term.\nQ: Many have perceived the Presidentâ€™s recent statements on the Supreme Court as a violation of the independence of the Judiciary. What do you think of this?\nA: Supreme Court judgments, like those of any other body, are open to legal criticism. The President has exercised this right. However, it is crucial that all branches of Government â€“ the Judiciary, Executive, and Legislatureâ€”respect their boundaries and roles.\nIntellectual criticism of judgments is normal and happens daily. Beyond that, we should observe and ensure that all branches maintain their independence and integrity.\nQ: There have been remarks made by the Opposition parties about renegotiating the deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Could you elaborate on whether it is possible to renegotiate or what possible amendments can be made?\nA: While discussions with the IMF are always possible, fundamentally changing the scope of the agreement is not feasible. The parameters, such as the percentage of GDP that should be taxed and the proportion allocated for foreign loan repayment, must be adhered to by any administration.\nWhile the approach to achieving these targets can be negotiated, major changes to the IMF agreement itself are unlikely. Such discussions by Opposition parties are often more about election rhetoric than practical policy changes.\nPic by Dushmantha Mayadunne\nThe post IMF pact: Major changes not possible â€“ Ali Sabry, PC appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Opinion','2024-06-29','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/30/opinion/26679/imf-pact-major-changes-not-possible-ali-sabry-pc/','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/4-2-1.jpg'),(8,_binary 'fŒRš*T‚Å˜~','Corruption is a power trip','<p>Corruption is about ego and buying influence the way molestation or rape is mostly a power trip thatâ€™s not about sexual gratification.

The corrupt do not know what to do with their money. They are not fleecing the public because they are trying hard to send their children to school, or making just enough to pay the house rent.\nMostly, the corrupt are being corrupt because they can be. They have no scruples and are ego driven and enjoy buying the influence they buy, because they are corruptand it comes as second nature.\nThis corruption can be seen time and again in different guises. Those who defended the same indefensible situation several times over, are corrupt, just because the system can be abused. They are brazen.\nbrickbats\nThere are those who said theyâ€™d retire from politics who are now back in the arena. These people are thick. They said theyâ€™d be out of the political arena and enjoyed subsequent time out in the wilderness, while others who had lost faced the brickbats. Now that there is a chance that they can wheedle their way back to power, those who said they are retiring from politics are at it again.\nSo corruption is seen to be brazen, and the culmination of the rat race of needless competition. Those who are corrupt think they are competing in the best way, buying influence, and being the men in the middle who manipulate the system at will. Somebody had recently asked the question, but what do they do with their money? Do they do something good at the very least and in fact do something vaguely positive with their ill-gotten gains, such as ensure that they have a great garden or something they could aesthetically admire?\nNo. Of course the corrupt buy flashy vehicles as thatâ€™s their petty way of showing that they are top of the pops, as it is said in common parlance. But oftentimes they have earned much more money through corrupt activities than could be spent on a couple of glitzy vehicles that scream conspicuous consumption.\nWhat do they do with all that money? Do they try to enhance the quality of their lives with it, or be more aesthetic in a non ostentatious and appreciably muted way?\nNo they donâ€™t. Mostly the corrupt merely stash their ill-gotten lucre because thatâ€™s a power trip in and of itself. They could be smug that they have hoodwinked and squirreled away a great deal of loot, and that there are a whole heap of gullible people out there who they have made absolute fools of.\nThat power trip is enough for the corrupt. Theyâ€™d keep some money, or more accurately theyâ€™d keep most of the stash away from prying eyes. With the rest, they try to buy up influence.\nThe corrupt think they can pay and get something done even if their cause is not legitimate. Sometimes in this society it takes money to get something done, even when whatâ€™s being sought is entirely legitimate.\nBut the corrupt seek to buy influence to peddle ideas and positions that are far from legitimate. Society is ego driven and fiercely competitive by nature in these times. That has been obvious if people have had a minimum of experience doing what is supposed to be acceptable in society, such as going to school and opting for a regular life.\nChasing fame and money are all ego-driven pursuits. But itâ€™s what the school system encourages unfortunately from day one. Those who seek to excel by fair means or foul are extolled. Others are cast by the wayside as losers.\nSo, some burn the midnight oil and get ahead in many competitive pursuits such as exams. But they have one goal in mind. It is that which is ego driven i.e of making as much money as possible and flaunting it, complemented by the pursuance of fame and glory so called.\nItâ€™s small wonder then that the corrupt see corruption as a shortcut to those types of goals in a society thatâ€™s already wedded to these false and ego-driven values.\nThe corrupt seek to purchase and influence those others who have burnt the midnight oil, because they feel they have a right to laugh at them too. The latter have pursued power and glory through legitimate means such as passing exams. But nevertheless they too are creatures of the same rat race.\nThe corrupt feel thatâ€™s fine then, because they can cock a snook at those who passed examinations and sought a more conventional route to money and glory, if all are in the same game. By now the most oblivious reader would also probably get the drift.\nThe corrupt justify themselves because they think they are doing what society wants them to do, which is to cover themselves in cash and be conspicuous. Thatâ€™s what after all, society seems to reward and deify.\nThatâ€™s why there seems to be so much brazen corruption within our system. Itâ€™s why politicians of various stripes come before the public and make the most preposterous claims even though the public knows none of it is true.\nmiscalculations\nBut the corrupt know that at the end of the day the truth can suffer an inglorious demise. They know that money can buy influence, evenamong voters.\nThough sometimes they may make certain miscalculations, the corrupt feel the influence they have purchased is enough to help them live another day even if things go wrong at the current conjuncture. As they say, â€œthose who fight and run away, live to run another day.â€ Said in jest, but words of wisdom, no doubt â€¦\nIn this system of influence peddling, it is the truly brave who could be incorruptible, and yet prevail. The corrupt would try to outmanoeuvre such people at every turn, but the results of corruption often speak for themselves and thatâ€™s where the palpably venal eventually get caught out.\nBut by the time they are caught out the facts have become obfuscated. It is the system that has grown legs of its own, because itâ€™s the core values of that system that are warped.\nThe system glorifies money and power, or money and glory or fame as the case may be, and hence it is not surprising that those values would be reflected in the exterior political structure. Itâ€™s a structure that perpetuates corrupt means at the expense of nobler pursuits such as feeding people, and providing them with a living wage.\nHonest men are scapegoated to pay for the sins of the more powerful. This is a trend that is seen in many areas of national endeavour. Sporting debacles come to mind.\nThe structure behind a great many debacles remains out of view of the pubic eye, and some pawns and minions may be sacrificed or trotted out to take the hit when debacles occur. But there are many out there who are willing to defend the structure, because corruption of course, and the exchange of filthy lucre, plays a huge part in that process.The several near collapses our national airline faced on many occasions in the past, may be a case in point.\nThose who are corrupt and seek to buy influence may of course never quite accomplish their ends because their ends are driven by unalloyed greed. Those who stash money as an end in itself also like to retain influence and power as an end in itself.\nThat becomes an impossible proposition however, because no amount of money can buy influence endlessly, and so the cycle repeats. Those consumed by greed would one day be hoist by their own petard, and time and again history has taught the avaricious that single lesson to no avail.\nBut itâ€™s the damage that the corrupt do that destroys lives and brings misery to people who were pawns in a bigger game played at a level they have no access to, and had no part in.\nIn multiple areas of pubic endeavour, however, itâ€™s the public that has been duped ,which means a part of the public so duped has to bear the consequences of their gullibility. But most of the public are sooner or later wiser to the truth. Itâ€™s just that they have no way of overcoming the stench of corruption that engulfs them.\nThey see no other way except to shrug their shoulders and move on. But seeing corruption for what it is may be a major victory by itself. The corrupt who swim against that tide of realisation, often know their game would be up, before they realise the folly of their ways.\nThe post Corruption is a power trip appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Opinion','2024-06-22','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/23/opinion/26212/corruption-is-a-power-trip/','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tag-SO-BY-RajpalA.jpg'),(9,_binary 'fŒRš*T‚Å˜','Economic growth imminent with price reduction of goods','<p>T oday, a drastic change can be seen in many sectors when compared to those days during the Aragalaya.

The socio-economic crisis triggered due to the Easter- Sunday attack in 2019 and also due to Covid-19 pandemic, many things happened in the country throughout that period until the end of the Aragalaya. Mostly those badly affected the countryâ€™s culture had taken place. Paying the last respect to loved ones is an usual practice in our society but due to the Covid-19 pandemic this practice has been changed and very few people attended weddings and funerals in fear of the epidemic. But now it has been changed as people participate in those functions freely.\nThat situation has been changed gradually with no more queues and restrictions for getting essential goods for peopleâ€™s day-to-day lives. Except for vehicle imports, shortages in some of the goods are no more.\nI think many people remember how prices of goods skyrocketed during those days and Sri Lanka was among the five countries with the highest inflation rate in the world. There was also a situation where the dollar value was changing rapidly. Initially, the dollar value was at Rs. 225 but due to the unprecedented economic crisis it depreciated making a rapid increase in the dollar value. This resulted in the dollar exchange in the blackmarket even at a higher rate and it rose upto Rs.470. At the same time, fuel prices and bank loan interest rates also increased causing a huge increase in prices of all commodities.\nRising commodity prices\nIn economics, the reasons for rising commodity prices and increasing inflation have been explained. The rise in prices is largely due to increased demand. However, apart from that, inflation can also increase due to various other reasons. It seems that economic reasons as well as non-economic reasons have influenced the rise in prices of goods and services in Sri Lanka during those days. The prices of commodities rose dramatically and taking advantage of the situation, the producers as well as the traders created an artificial price hike in all goods.\nIt is normal for the price of milk powder to rise when the rupee depreciates and the dollar appreciates but there was an unusual hike in milk powder prices. Initially, the price of a 400 gram packet of locally produced Highland milk powder was Rs 290, while the price of a 400 gram packet of imported Anchor milk powder was Rs 370. However, under that scenario the price of a packet of Highland milk powder went up to Rs.1,150 and the price of a packet of Anchor milk powder went up to Rs. 1,050 due to increase in the dollar value. However, it is unclear what caused the price increase of the locally produced Highland milk powder. In this way, the prices of almost all goods in the country were subject to price hikes by two to three-folds. Some traders and manufacturers put the prices of goods up according to their whims and fancies.\nWhen I entered a particular supermarket, I was surprised to see how their staff was relabelling the price tags of the commodities with higher prices. I think most supermarkets did the same. The prices of goods started to rise mainly due to low production of goods in the country, limitations in foreign supply chains, shortage of foreign exchange and depreciation of the rupee. The price hike reached its maximum level in June and July in 2022. When considering the prices of goods during the post-independence period, there was not a significant decrease in prices but showed an increase in them.\nThe reason for that trend was that there was a continuous increase in inflation. On the other hand, there was a continuous increase in prices of goods mainly due to over dependency of foreign goods and the continuous depreciation of the rupee. When considering the situation in other countries, it seems that the price of goods had not gone down, but had gone up.\nThe increase in commodity prices after the Covid-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka was an unusual situation. The above mentioned special reasons have affected but after easing off those reasons there should be a decrease in the prices of goods. For example, the situation caused by the devaluation of the rupee can be mentioned here. Although the dollar reached Rs. 470, it has now dropped to Rs. 300.\nInflation has come down while the prices of fuel, electricity and bank interest rates have also come down. As a result of those decreases in prices and inflation, the prices of the countryâ€™s goods should decrease to a significant level but such a decrease has not yet been reported. The reason for this is that many producers and traders in the country try to gain high profits by retaining prices of goods at a higher level.\nIn this way, the people are not getting the benefit of price decrease as the importers and local producers do not reduce the prices of goods and services according to the changes in the cost of production. But the manufacturers, importers and traders have not realised that they are compelled to reduce the prices willingly or unwillingly, soon.\nBuilding materials\nWhen prices are high, people donâ€™t buy goods, therefore sellers have to bear the losses. For example, the price of building materials in the country has increased significantly but there has been no change in those prices when the dollar has decreased. As a result, the countryâ€™s construction industry has badly affected and a drastic decrease in building material sales. This has caused a huge loss to those who sell building materials. However, there is a price reduction in some of the building materials and a further price reduction of those materials can be expected. When the prices of building material are reduced, there will be a boom in the construction industry.\nWhen there is a price reduction in goods, it will boost the economy due to high the demand. The demand increases when peopleâ€™s purchasing power is increased. It will increase the demand for goods in all sectors while production of all sectors is increased. This will ultimately result in a sound economic growth.\nIt is now evident that the government has taken all measures to reduce the prices of goods while strengthening the rupee value. Fuel, electricity and bank loan interest have now been reduced resulting in the reduction in production cost. But, there is no significant price reduction in goods and services yet.\nEven though there is a considerable price increase of a loaf of bread, it seems that today there is a competition between bakery owners. While some bakery owners are trying to maintain the current prices of a loaf of bread, some owners seem ready to reduce the price of bread. The end result may be that the price of bread will gradually decrease. This is the case with all goods and services. When the cost of production is reduced and the prices are not reduced compared to the production cost, a price competition will be created and that will result in the price reduction of goods.\nDue to proper economic management by President Ranil Wickremesinghe amidst various challenges and difficulties, an environment has now been created in the country to reduce the prices of goods. If the manufacturing sector understands this scenario and reduces prices, an accelerated economic growth of the country is imminent.\nThe post Economic growth imminent with price reduction of goods appeared first on Sunday Observer.','Opinion','2024-06-22','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/23/opinion/26216/economic-growth-imminent-with-price-reduction-of-goods/','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tag-SO-Weekend-Review.jpg');

belt</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.sundayobserver.lk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunday Observer</a>.</p>','Schoolboys from as many as 83 rugby playing schools have been held to ransom by striking referees following an assault on one of their members making a mockery of sports promotion in the country where strikes and trade union actions are despised and frowned upon.\nIn an age when rogue conduct and rampant corruption among so-called caretakers of sports in the country rule the roost, schoolboys have been made pawns, their keepers become showcase puppets and their commercial partners turned into sadists while thugs call the shots and referees resort to a boycott of rugby, a sport they claim to foster and even earn from.\nThe disruption came barely a month after the new inter-school rugby season was launched with players paraded on stage and the Ministers of Education and Sports gracing the occasion making speeches promising fair-play and accountability.\nBut all bought to zero with three match officials brutalized by thug supporters of one school Science College last Sunday at the Air Force ground at Ratmalana considered the safest of all venues without any pre-match complaints.\nWith a new set of referees now running the show and their decisions respected by players over the past few years, resorting to trade union action made them pathetically ordinary in their off-field conduct unbecoming of match officials who are paid to perform a task.\nThe contention is that had the referees been bold enough as they are on the field of play, they should have taught Science College a lesson and refused to blow only their matches and not penalize other schools that had nothing to do with last Sundayâ€™s incident.\nThe so-called Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association, the caretaker of the countryâ€™s rugby cradle, and their new found Advisors did very little to prevent the disruption of matches living up to a puppet or self-professed image while hundreds of schoolboys who were put through hard rigorous pre-season training for the occasion were left jaded.\nThe action taken by the referees smacked of typical Sri Lanka style where the rest have to pay for the sins of one man or individuals fighting for their rights at the expense of the people.\nWhat cannot be hidden from the truth is that the referees had hit the players of 83 schools below the belt in a spoil-sport move most foul despite police moving in swiftly and arresting the assailants who could face charges of criminal assault.\nThe post Trade unionist rugby referees

I love the sport.â€ Fellow Grand Slam champions Novak Djokovic, Martina Navratilova, John McEnroe and Iga Swiatek applauded from the side of the court, alongside Tim Henman â€“ who Murray replaced as British menâ€™s number one in 2005 â€“ and current players Dan Evans, Jack Draper and Cameron Norrie.\nMurray is set to appear again later this week, having signed up to the mixed doubles with fellow British Grand Slam champion Emma Raducanu.\nâ€œIt was obviously very special to play with Jamie, weâ€™ve not the chance to do it before,â€ Murray, who won the first of his three major titles at the 2012 US Open, said.\nâ€œIt was a race against time to get out here and physically it wasnâ€™t easy but Iâ€™m glad we were able to do it one time together.â€\nWimbledon has been the scene of many of the defining moments of Murrayâ€™s career and the emotional ties are why he fought so hard to play one final time.\nMurrayâ€™s chances of a last hurrah had been thrown into serious doubt.\nA back issue caused a loss of power and feeling in his right leg during a match at Queenâ€™s three weeks ago.\nThe only option was an operation on 22 June to remove a cyst close to his spine, but it left Murray in a race against time to be fit.\nUltimately, having left making a decision until the night before his scheduled singles match on Tuesday, he realised with a heavy heart it was not possible to play a five-set match.\nGoing out alongside 38-year-old Jamie in the shorter doubles format was the next best thing.\nThe plan, which was initially put in place around the French Open in late May, did come to fruition.\nNot since 1995 had a menâ€™s doubles first-round match been put on Centre Court.\nThis occasion could not have been scheduled anywhere else.\nMurray reached his first Wimbledon final in 2012, losing to Roger Federer in an four-set match which left him in tears and changed public perception about him.\nRedemption came when he won Olympic singles gold on the same court against the same opponent four weeks later.\nA year on, Murray ended Britainâ€™s 77-year wait for a Wimbledon menâ€™s singles champion by beating world number one Djokovic in a moment of national celebration.\nAnother triumph at the All England Club came in 2016, which he says he enjoyed more.\nAfter both victories, Murray walked back through the marbled corridors of Centre Court â€“ like tradition dictates â€“ and was given a guard of honour before stepping on to the balcony to greet the adoring fans below.\nThe same ceremonial walk was made by Murray again on Thursday night.\nWhile Murray had not won the trophy again, it was the only farewell â€“ of sorts â€“ fit for a player who has led British tennis with distinction.

Tonight I officially announce my retirement from the WWE.\nâ€˜I hear a mixed opinion out there. A lot of questions maybe, right? Like, why here? I want to talk about that for a second. I want to talk about Toronto. Matter of fact, I want to talk about Canada. Matter of fact, I want to talk about Canadians.\nâ€˜Iâ€™ve been doing this a while. Iâ€™ve been in WWE for over two decades and in that time Iâ€™ve seen incredible waves of prosperity like we got right now. WWE is the hottest ticket in town, no doubt.\nâ€˜And Iâ€™ve also seen tremendous hardship and thatâ€™s when nobody knows your name, nobody wants to be your friend and only the most dedicated, hardcore fans stand by your side.\nâ€˜So in all those years one of the most important, one of the most impressive things that I learned was whether the WWE was hot or cold, Canadians always show up.\nâ€˜All of you built this to what it is today which makes this, in my mind, the perfect place to say what Iâ€™ve got to say.\nâ€˜This farewell does not end tonight. It is filled with opportunity. Everybody, RAW makes history next year when it moves to Netflix. Iâ€™ve never been a part of RAW on Netflix. That is history. That is a first and I will be there.\nâ€˜Along with that history-making first, we are going to build so many unforgettable lasts.\nâ€˜The 2025 Royal Rumble will be my last. The 2025 Elimination Chamber will be my last and Iâ€™m here tonight to announce that WrestleMania Las Vegas in 2025 will be the last WrestleMania I compete in.\nâ€˜I know, I know. Thatâ€™s a lot to take in. Probably a lot of questions out there, which is why Iâ€™m telling you right now I am going to kick off the press conference right after the show and I will be fielding any and all questions to do with my retirement.\nâ€˜I want to say thank you. What an incredible gesture of kindness. I want to say thank you. Thank you so much for letting me play in the house that you built for so many years.\nâ€˜Thank you so much always for your voice, because itâ€™s really loud and your honesty because itâ€™s beautifully brutal. and most of all thank you so much for allowing me to be here with you tonight to let the world know we are planning something unforgettable which also involves me returning to Toronto to kick some a**.\nâ€˜So if you are watching at home or here in Toronto or if youâ€™re a WWE superstar, if you want some hurry up and come get some because the last time is now.â€™\nCena, who walked out naked at the Oscars in March, is level with WWE legend Ric Flair for the most world titles in wrestling history with 16.\nHeâ€™s been at the heart of many of the companyâ€™s legendary storylines in the past 20 years, battling the likes of Dwayne â€˜The Rockâ€™ Johnson, Triple H, Brock Lesnar and Randy Orton.\nCenaâ€™s acting career has taken off in recent years.

That is the best final weâ€™ve ever done.â€\nOn his win, Brin reacted with: â€œIâ€™m absolutely chuffed to bits. I canâ€™t breathe! Iâ€™m a big mix of my background, my culture and all the opportunities my parents have given me. Theyâ€™ve been incredible and Iâ€™ve done it for them as much as Iâ€™ve done it for myself. The experience itself has been incredible and to top it off with this is just the most amazing thing, ever.â€\nMasterChef judge, John Torode, says: â€œBrin is an extraordinary cook and an amazing talent. He takes combinations that donâ€™t sound like they belong together, but they actually work. Today, heâ€™s delivered three absolutely sensational courses that could grace the table of any restaurant up and down the land.â€\nMasterChef judge, Gregg Wallace, commented: â€œThese are ingredient combinations that Brin is inventing. That makes him dangerously clever. Heâ€™s got technique, heâ€™s got creativity. In my experience, Brin is unique. One of the cleverest talents Iâ€™ve ever, ever seen.â€\nBrin grew up in Chelmsford, Essex and moved to Bristol for his veterinary studies, where he still lives with his fiancÃ©, Anna â€“ who he says is his biggest supporter (and occasional critic).\nHe credits his parents, who are originally from Sri Lanka, for inspiring his love of food and flavour: â€œCooking definitely runs in my family. Iâ€™m really lucky that Iâ€™ve got this amazing spicy culinary background from my parents. They are great cooks and Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to be treated to amazing Tamil Sri Lankan flavours throughout my life.â€\nTalking about what drives his creativity in the kitchen, he added: â€œThe areas of cooking I love are truly an amalgamation of my Tamil Sri Lankan heritage and my British upbringing. I have a passion for creating dishes with bold flavours but refining them to high standards with European techniques. I like to pull flavour combinations from all over the world and create balanced dishes.â€\nLooking back over his time on MasterChef, Brin says: â€œMy personal highlight of the competition was the 20th anniversary dinner. Receiving a huge standing ovation from a room full of culinary royalty was one of the greatest feelings Iâ€™ve ever had. Iâ€™ve loved cooking for John and Gregg but itâ€™s been absolutely nerve racking and waiting for their feedback during tastings feels like an eternity! They are such a pleasure to cook for. No matter how stressful this competition can be, itâ€™s been fantastic. Itâ€™s been one of the greatest experiences of my life and all I know is, I have to involve cooking in my futureâ€.\nOn his next goals, Brin says: â€œIâ€™d love to have a future in the food industry. Waking up every morning knowing that Iâ€™m doing something I absolutely love would be a great feeling. It would be incredible to write a cookbook and, explore supper clubs or private dining. Longer term, Iâ€™d love food to take me all over the world. MasterChef has already given me an opportunity to cook for some of my absolute heroes â€“ including Tom Kitchin, Monica Galetti, Pierre Koffman. Iâ€™d love to do another Chefâ€™s Table for some more of the greats and see what they really think of my food! I feel like Iâ€™ve got so much more to learn and this is hopefully just the beginning.â€Â (BBC / Colombo Gazette)\n','2024-05-22','Entertainment','http://colombogazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p0hzkk6r.jpg','https://colombogazette.com/2024/05/23/british-sri-lankan-wins-uk-masterchef/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=british-sri-lankan-wins-uk-masterchef'),(3,'Mount Lavinia Hotel celebrates Wellness and Wellbeing with Sunset Yoga Event','In the spirit of wellness and wellbeing, Mount Lavinia Hotel is thrilled to announce a special Sunset Yoga session with Yoga Alliance Certified instructor Shabna. \nThis unique event, aimed at promoting a balanced and healthy lifestyle through yoga, mindfulness, and breathwork, will take place on Saturday, 29 June 2024, from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM at the picturesque Paradise Beach.

Rithihi captures Marine Researcher Ramani Jayawardena and physiotherapist and Kuppameniya Founder Melanie Daetwyler-De Silva who are both of Swiss-Sri Lankan origin.Â  In addition, Interior Designer and multi-faceted entrepreneur Annika Fernando who has a Sri Lankan father and mother who was Dutch, Danish and Austrian with a German upbringing to realise the relevance of the Anavila story to Sri Lanka.\nAnchoring the saris on a canvas of white with the rose as the primary motif, Anavila explained the thought process behind the collection to the intimate audience gathered at the store. â€œThe idea of a summer collection danced in my head for a long time and when I went back to Puducherry 25 years later, I could see that cultural fluidity in the drape of linen saris â€“ the ease, the grace and the elegance which is very much the persona of the South Asian woman. Linen is the perfect celebration to that cross-pollination of cultures that fuse the Tamil and French way of life.â€\nEach of the saris is an opus; a legacy regaling a story of a passionate experiment blended with indigenous textiles and artisanal skill. With a desire to modernize and deconstruct the age-old sari, Ã‰TÃ‰ holds within its weaves elements of a garden in full bloom or the minute detailing of a single feature symbolic of a languid summer day.Â  As Ramani mentions, â€œGarments shouldnâ€™t necessarily represent cultural identity; they can stand alone as statements. The way Anavila drapes saris show how easily they can be perceived as Western outfits.â€\nThe piece de resistance in the Ã‰TÃ‰ collection is the ivory khadi silk sari that took a team of applique artisans and hand embroiderers 400 days to complete. The detailing is meticulous, the work exacting and the process surely exhausting, but it is an oeuvre that chronicles the entirety of how artisanal hands weave cultural identity into an ever-evolving newness.\nâ€œI believe clothing for the creator is just another outlet to funnel design and craftsmanship, and for the wearer, a means of expression,â€ says Annika, who identifies with wearing South Asian designs. â€œA designer could create a piece to communicate a point of view and the wearer may not read it or express it in the same way.â€\nMelanie perfectly captures the Anavila spirit in this collection, saying, â€œClothes have the power to express individual style while also serving to represent cultural identity. What I wear reflects this belief as I combine traditional elements with contemporary designs to showcase my appreciation for both heritage and innovation.â€','2024-06-23','Lifestyle','http://colombogazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Textile-Talks-Photo-5.jpg','https://colombogazette.com/2024/06/23/rithihi-showcases-newest-collection-storied-on-the-french-tamil-influence-in-puducherry/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rithihi-showcases-newest-collection-storied-on-the-french-tamil-influence-in-puducherry'),(8,'â€˜Hunger Gamesâ€™ actor Donald Sutherland dies','Donald Sutherland, the beloved actor who starred in scores of films from The Dirty Dozen, MASH and Klute to Animal House and Ordinary People to Pride & Prejudice and The Hunger Games franchise and won an Emmy for Citizen X, died Thursday in Miami after a long illness. He was 88.\nThe 2017 Honorary Oscar recipient also is the father of Emmy-winning 24 actor Kiefer Sutherland and veteran CAA Media Finance exec Roeg Sutherland. CAA confirmed the news to Deadline.\nIn some of his most well-known roles, he perfected a laconic, wry and dead-serious delivery as such characters as the cool-headed amateur murder investigator John Klute, opposite Jane Fondaâ€™s terrified, erratic call girl Bree Daniels, in Klute; as the Hawkeye Pierce in the film MASH, where he played opposite Elliott Gouldâ€™s cut-up Trapper John; and in Nicolas Reogâ€™s Donâ€™t Look Now as skeptical John Baxter, who does not believe the claims of wife Laura (Julie Christie) that their recently dead daughter is reaching out from the other side.\nIn one early change-of-pace characterization, Sutherland played a sadistic fascist in Bernardo Bertolucciâ€™s 1976 epic 1900, in which his character gleefully swings a child by the heels, bashing the boyâ€™s head against a wall.\nBorn on July 17, 1935, in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, Donald Sutherland amassed some 200 film and TV credits spanning more than 60 years, from guesting on episodes of 1960s series including Suspense, The Avengers, Court Martial and The Odd Man to last yearâ€™s Paramount+ drama Bass Reeves. His big break in movies came with Robert Aldrichâ€™s star-packed 1967 World War II drama The Dirty Dozen, playing Vernon Pinkley opposite Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, George Kennedy, Telly Savalas and others. A hit in theaters, it remains a seminal American war movie.\nHis next big role was as Capt. Benjamin Franklin â€œHawkeyeâ€ Pierce in Robert Altmanâ€™s 1970 Korean War dramedy MASH. The alternatively harrowing and hilarious film earned five Oscar nominations including Best Picture, winning for Ring Lardner Jr.â€™s biting screenplay, and fueled the 1972-83 CBS series in which Alda Alda played Hawkeye.\nSutherland followed that with another star-laden war movie, 1970â€™s Kellyâ€™s Heroes, playing Sgt. Oddball alongside Clint Eastwood, Don Rickles, Savalas and others. That led to perhaps his biggest star turn, in the 1971 Alan J. Pakula crime drama Klute. He starred opposite Fonda as New York Detective John Klute, who is hired to find a chemical company executive who has disappeared. Fonda won her first Oscar for the role, and Andy Lewis & Dave Lewis were nominated for their Original Screenplay.\nSutherlandâ€™s next big movie was Donâ€™t Look Now,\nSutherland won a Golden Globe for the television movie Path to War, an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe for his performance in the miniseries Citizen X. His extensive television credits also include The Undoing, Trust, Dirty Sexy Money, and The Pillars of the Earth, among many others.\nSutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette; sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer; daughter Rachel; and four grandchildren. A private celebration of life will be held by the family.

The estimated expenditure on social welfare, public health and education is around Rs. 1.5 trillion which is close to Rs. 3 trillion. The estimated income at best is about Rs. 4 trillion annually.\nThere is a surplus of about Rs. 1 trillion expenditure minus income but that is before taking into account the domestic interest costs and debt repayments which is around Rs. 2.5 trillion ending up with a Rs. 1.5 trillion deficit.\nAnd when considering the capital expenditure on top of that, which is Rs. 1 trillion there is a budget deficit of about Rs. 2.2 trillion.\nFinancing this deficit in the past was done by borrowings and printing money he said.\nTo overcome this situation the government had to indulge in difficult but necessary decisions to increase taxation to 36%, VAT to 18% and introduce tax on motor vehicles.\nThe motor industry came under prohibition. But that again there was a reason. At that time the country had exported about USD 12 billion of goods and had tourism and remittances of about USD 6 or 7 billion and from other services received about another two USD 3 billion, which added to around USD 22 billion. With this the country managed to just bridge it closely and whatever difference was borrowed from international markets.\nHowever when the country lost tourism and remittance income of USD 7-8 billion the government had to impose controls on imports and the motor industry was one of the first casualties of that.\nâ€œAlthough others have been restored, motor vehicle imports are still banned.

This initiative marks a significant milestone for the countryâ€™s clean energy and agricultural industries.\nThe 85kWp hybrid semi-transparent solar panel project, operational since February 29, 2024, installed two metres above the tea plantation at the Hanthana Ratnasiri Wickramanayake National Training Centre, Kandy is projected to generate electricity to power 19 households, contributing to the national grid with a 24 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery energy storage system.\nThe project complements the tea plants with a strategically placed LED lighting system above, creating a controlled environment for optimal growth.These LED lights leverage solar power efficiently by utilising targeted spectrums beneficial to tea plants, consuming less energy for sustainable operation, and emitting minimal heat to maintain ideal growing temperatures â€“ all contributing to increased yields without burdening the local grid.\nThe facility also complements a groundwater pump with a borehole arrangement to facilitate water supply for both the tea plants at the project area and the nearby estate community.\nâ€œThis project has the opportunity to address both issues of achieving energy security and overcoming agricultural challenges in a land-stressed country like Sri Lanka,â€ said Professor Janaka Ekanayake, Senior Professor from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Peradeniya.\nâ€œProjects such as this are being implemented around the world, and this is the first time Sri Lanka has undertaken an initiative.â€\nProfessor Ekanayake also highlighted the potential for expanding this technology to other crops like vanilla, tomato, and bell pepper cultivations as well. The project, based on an 800-square-metre tea estate, is expected to generate well above 100 MWh of electricity annually.Ranjith Sepala, Chairman of SLSEA and Dr. Sulakshana Jayawardena, Secretary to MOPE said, â€œThis initiative has the potential to revolutionise the way we use our land resources for both food and energy production, and it is a perfect example of how innovation can solve multiple societal challenges.â€\nHayleys Solar, the renewable energy arm of Hayleys Fentons, was selected for the supply and installation through a competitive bid to build the Agrivoltaics Demonstration Project.\nState Minister of Plantation Industries, Lohan Ratwatte stated, â€œthis project marks a significant stride towards sustainable development in our agricultural sector.\nThe increasing demand for food and energy in Sri Lanka, coupled with the challenges of fossil fuel-based electricity, highlights the importance of renewable energy.â€\nProf. Priyantha Wijayatunga, Senior Director, Energy, ADB, said, â€œAgrivoltaics offer a unique opportunity to address energy security in a land-constrained country like Sri Lanka and its agricultural challenges. We are confident that this project will serve as a model for wider applications of achieving sustainable food security and energy access not only in Sri Lanka but also in the region.\nThe post Hayleys Solar selected for first ADB-developed, financed, agrivoltaics project in Sri Lanka appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-07-08','Business',NULL,'https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/09/business/584043/hayleys-solar-selected-for-first-adb-developed-financed-agrivoltaics-project-in-sri-lanka/'),(21,'Eliminated Sri Lankan contestant given another chance on MasterChefÂ Australia','By Easwaran Rutnam\nEliminated Sri Lankan contestant Savindri Perera was given another chance on MasterChef Australia after being picked in the redemption round.\nSavi was among eight eliminated contestants who returned for a chance to cook their way back into the 2024 competition.\nThe judges loved the Sri Lankan dishes prepared by Savindri Perera.\nâ€œSavâ€™s cooked her way back into our hearts,â€ MasterChef 2024 Australia said on X.\nAfter tasting the delicious Sri Lankan dishes, the MasterChef Australia judges picked Savindri, better known as Sav, to make a comeback to the competition.\nBorn in Colombo where she lived until moving to Adelaide aged 18, Sav describes her cooking style as rustic, generous and colourful.\nShe lists onion, garlic and curry leaves as her holy trinity, nothing happens in Sri Lankan cooking without them.\nFriendly, fun, strong-willed and sassy, Sav has a steely determination that she will bring to each cook, competitive to the core and born with the will to win.

Sri Lanka Insurance Life was able to increase its asset base to Rs. 221 Billion and the life fund to Rs. 180.8 Billion, to further strengthen its position as the largest and strongest local insurer. Furthermore, the monthly average Life Insurance claim settlement exceeds Rs. 1 Billion amounting to around Rs. 12 Billion annually in addition to the annual bonus declaration.

This achievement sets Sri Lanka Insurance Life apart in the corporate sector, demonstrating its unwavering commitment to delivering on our promises and standing strong as a leader in the industry.\nCustomer centricity is one of the key strategic pillars of SLICâ€™s business drive and therefore the organsiation is determined to look at identifying new market segment and understanding the needs of its customers to develop affordable and suitable products. â€˜Wealth Plusâ€™, a short-term investment plan with long-term protection, now enhanced with flexible payment term options was launched for greater customer convenience.

Teacher trade unions too were set to stage a strike today (Tuesday) over the same demand, although it was only recently that they received a substantial pay hike. As State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya correctly stated, the Government was unable to meet such a demand for want of adequate finances, adding that the Government had already granted all possible benefits to state sector employees and wanted them to say how it (Government) could find the money for granting the demand. Had anyone got an answer, he was willing to discuss such a proposal. It was only the other day that President Ranil Wickremesinghe warned the teachers that he would be forced to take stringent measures if they continue to resort to strikes, observing that teachers should be inside the classrooms and not on the roads. Childrenâ€™s future could not be allowed to be jeopardized by teacher strikes, he added.\nIn fact, the Government should consider drastic steps to end what has now become routine trade union action across all sectors, causing immense damage to the economy, not to mention the distress caused to the public. There are 1.4 million public sector employees in the country and, as pointed out by State Minister Siyambalapitiya, it is well-nigh impossible to grant such a demand without making the country go bankrupt. Teachers, above all else, should understand this reality, particularly at a time when the economy is just about coming out of the woods. They (teachers) too have children who are schooling, and wonâ€™t this continuing spate of strikes by them affect their children as well? The President should lose no time in putting into true effect the Essential Services (ES) decree and punish all trade union leaders who are pulling their members out of work in the Government service. In fact, we feel that the reluctance on the part of the authorities to act in terms of ES by dismissing strikers is the main cause that has emboldened them to continue striking, with no let or hindrance. Had the authorities made examples of a few striking TU members before this, things would not have descended to this level. At least now they (authorities) should open their eyes and get tough. If not, the same pattern is going to follow until the economy collapses totally.\nThere is little doubt that the JVP and the Frontline Peopleâ€™s Party are responsible for inciting these strikes. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who, one day, hopes to become the countryâ€™s leader, would not want to take over an economically collapsed state. At least this factor should compel him to desist from bringing the workers onto the streets even at this late stage. Strikes should be resorted to only when negotiations fail and as a last resort. On the contrary, today strikes are being called at the drop of a hat. How can the state machinery function under such circumstances? Wonâ€™t this result in confusion and chaos all around? Such a state of affairs must be put to an end with a firm hand. The law should be implemented to the fullest and the police called upon to get tougher in dealing with striking workers. What happens at present is that the Police are reduced to mere bystanders and are even shown on TV getting into light conversation with the culprits. No doubt, all this has made the strikers lose whatever inhibitions to act as they do at present.\nProlonged strikes have today become a way of life in this country, affecting all sectors including tourism. Recently, TV showed a group of tourists waving their train tickets at the cameras near the Fort Railway station, indicating their helplessness and frustration at being unable to make their train trip to the hill country due to a rail strike. It is doubtful if these tourists would ever visit this country again. Not just the touristsâ€”how about prospective foreign investors? Would they be willing to park their money in a country where the workforce is constantly on the streets? Little wonder it was recently reported that some investors have taken their businesses to countries such as Malaysia and the Maldives. The Government must also ascertain if the stepped-up strike action has anything to do with the upcoming Presidential Election with a view to making the Government unpopular. This is because the strikes cause inconvenience and harassment to the general public, who invariably vent their anger on the Government. That is why it is necessary to ascertain if there are political parties behind the current spate of strikes in order to make political headway in this fashion. If necessary, laws should be brought in to punish these political inciters. Even during the time of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, left political parties continually organised strikes, particularly in the ports, in order to deprive people of food supplies and invite their wrath on the authorities. A similar move could not be ruled out even at present. It is well known that certain left-leaning political parties are masters at creating disaffection among the public with the Government in power. Organising strikes is a surefire way of achieving this end, going by experience. Those using strikes as a convenient political tool should be punished under the law.\nThe post Strikes as a political tool? appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-07-08','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/09/editorial/584203/strikes-as-a-political-tool/'),(30,'A new era for the UK','Change Begins. Those were the two words that Sir Keir Starmer highlighted on the podium following the spectacular landslide victory of his Labour Party at the British elections after 14 tumultuous years of Conservative rule. Rishi Sunak, the first Prime Minister of Colour in the UK, not only conceded defeat but also accepted responsibility for it. It is also a rare victory for a Left-leaning party in a world that is increasingly turning to the Hard Right.\nFormer Crown Prosecutor Starmer, as Prime Minister, will have to lead a country that is a vestige of what it was even 10 years ago thanks to the self-inflicted wound of Brexit. It was also a personal victory for Starmer, who entered politics in 2015 and assumed Labour leadership after a disastrous spell by Jeremy Corbyn, perceived as a hard Leftist. Starmer is known as a Centrist with a penchant for a balanced approach to the many troubles plaguing the Union.\nChange cannot come soon enough for the voters who have been fed up with a string of disastrous policy failures by five Conservative Prime Ministers, including Boris â€œPartygateâ€ Johnson and Liz Truss, who governed for just 49 days, the shortest stint of any British Premier.\nThough widely expected, the scale of Labourâ€™s victory was simply overwhelming. While Labour gained more than 410 Seats in Britainâ€™s First-Past-the-Post (FPP) voting system, the Conservatives were reduced to less than 120 Seats (at the time of writing). This was their worst defeat in living memory, with 250 Conservative Seats being lost, including all Seats in Wales. Liberal Democrats also had a strong showing, winning more than 70 Seats, up from the 11 they previously held. The Scottish National Party (SNP) won less than 10 Seats, but in a way, the biggest winner was arch Brexiteer Nigel Farageâ€™s Reform UK, which went from Zero to four Seats, with Farage himself entering Parliament on his eighth attempt from Clacton, Essex, beating the Conservatives.\nBut Brexit itself was hardly under discussion during the run-up to the poll, with voters more or less resigned to their fate. Starmer is however expected to renegotiate some of the more restrictive terms of the Brexit deal, stopping short of rejoining the EU Single Market or Customs Union. On the other hand, immigration, one of the main topics that led to Brexit, was very much in play. Sunakâ€™s â€œStop the Boatsâ€ campaign fell flat and the cruel Rwanda repatriation plan was dead on arrival, with Starmer having already pledged to abolish it. Starmer has promised to deal with illegal immigration in a more humane manner, while rethinking some of the more controversial decisions of the Home Office (tainted forever by the Windrush scandal) with regard to legal immigration, including visas for foreign students.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg facing Starmer. He will have to rejuvenate an economy that has hardly grown for years, only to be battered further by Covid, Brexit and a huge debt burden. Starmer might have to resort to tax hikes or welfare cuts, however unpalatable they may be, to fix the economy. Unemployment is at an all-time high, with 6.7 million people receiving Universal Credit, a sort of a handout. There is also a chronic housing shortage, exacerbated by rising homelessness. The National Health Service (NHS), once the pride of the UK, is crumbling with ambulance wait times stretching to several hours and even critically ill patients having to wait outside hospitals. A strike by junior doctors has also not helped.\nMost Local Government authorities have gone bankrupt and are unable to repair the crumbling infrastructure facilities. Starmer will also have to decide the future of the proposed HS2 High Speed Rail project, which is running over budget and also the third runway for Heathrow. The proposed acquisition of Royal Mail by a foreign company could also pose a headache for Starmer, as Labour has traditionally not favoured privatization.\nNot much is expected to change on the foreign affairs front, with Starmer having already pledged support for NATO and Ukraine in the war against Russia. Starmer may choose to tread a more cautious path on the Gaza War as he has consistently voiced support for a Palestinian State, while stressing that it cannot happen unilaterally or in a vacuum without going through the due process. Nevertheless, the UK is expected to remain a strong ally of Israel under Starmer. Closer home, it will be interesting to see how Starmer deals with France, where a Far-Right Premier is certain to come to power after the second round of elections on July 7. Emmanuel Macron will still be President, but it will be an uneasy cohabitation that could have serious implications for the EU and the UK.\nAcross the pond, developments are even more worrying as there is a real possibility of Donald Trump reclaiming the White House in November, especially after President Joe Bidenâ€™s faltering performance at the first CNN debate. Starmer, on his part, has reassured voters that the UK-US relationship is above personalities. Indeed, in Starmer, the UK may have found the perfect antidote for toxic politics that bedevil much of the world.\nThe post A new era for the UK appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-07-05','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/06/editorial/582662/a-new-era-for-the-uk/'),(31,'An irreplaceable Tamil Leader','The passing away of Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader R. Sampanthan, removes from our midst a rare moderate Tamil political leader who was against the division of the country in any form, though a firm advocate of devolution as the answer to the National Question. His loss has certainly created a huge void not only in the Tamil Political firmament but also in national politics. The positions he always took cut across the ethnic divide and encompassed the larger Sri Lankan community.\nThe accolades showered on him by political leaders of all hues bear this out in ample measure. The condolence message from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also a testament to the respect and honour foreign leaders accorded him. President Ranil Wickremesinghe was among those who expressed their grief at the passing away of the veteran Tamil political leader.\nIn his special condolence message, the President noted that notwithstanding representing the TULF and the TNA, the former Opposition Leader consistently upheld Sri Lankaâ€™s territorial integrity. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa too was deeply saddened by the demise of Sampanthan, a personal friend, saying that his death was a loss not only to Tamil politics but also to the nation itself.\nThe late Sampanthan was an eloquent Parliamentarian who spoke from the heart articulating his views in a candid manner. Many Parliament reporters, instead of taking down his speech, simply listened to him which indeed was a pleasant experience. He never referred to any written script and was a master of repartee. He boldly expressed his views not only concerning Tamils in the North but also touching on national issues and advocating justice for Sinhala and Muslim communities for any perceived injustice.\nPerhaps, this could be one of reasons which endeared him so much to politicians of the South, even those hardliners as demonstrated by their expression of condolences and presence to pay their last respects. Having his education in two schools in the South may also be one of the reasons for his affinity with the majority Sinhalese to the extent of standing on behalf of their interests.\nR. Sampanthan was a firm advocate for the implementation of the 13th Amendment as the best answer for devolution and consistently expressed his views in this respect both within and outside Parliament. It is indeed sad that he had to pass away at this time when the President and the Opposition Leader both expressed the intention to fully implement the 13th Amendment. He would certainly have been the happiest had he been alive. It would have been the culmination of his long cherished dream.\nHe held on to the conviction that the 13th Amendment would be the ultimate solution even at a time the LTTE rejected such a move in toto and even killed pro-13A Tamil politicians. This was at a time that all Tamil Politicians of the North were compelled to toe the line of the Tigers. His indeed was a tightrope walk.\nHe never wavered in his commitment to serve the interests of the Tamil community who looked up to him to promote their causes. He was, indeed, a leader who could inspire confidence in all who came in touch with him. Entering Politics as a youth in the 1950s his service to his community during these long years was reciprocated time and again by being repeatedly elected to Parliament from his Trincomalee constituency.\nWhatever the provocation no MP retaliated when Sampanthan was on his feet in the House. Even the Speaker always acceded to his request for additional time out of respect for him. His calm and collected demeanour won for him many friends in Parliament. It would not be wrong to say that he was treated differently to other MPs by all Members, perhaps, because of his calm composure.\nIt would not be an exaggeration to state that Tamil politics would not be the same again without Sampanthan. He acted as a calming influence against militant MPs from the North. As the Opposition Leader from 2015 to 2018 he held himself exceptionally well and performed the duties attached to that office with skill and responsibility. This, in a way, cast him in the role of a national leader since his duties as Leader of the Opposition transcended his interests only in the Tamil community of the North and the East whom he represented.\nThe best tribute all politicians of the North and the East could pay the late Sampanthan is to follow in his footsteps of moderation in outlook with regard to the National Question. The late politician shunned all forms of extremism even though this would not have endeared him much to those militant elements among his community who advocated separatism. Sampanthan spoke and conducted himself realistically. On this occasion it would be worth recalling a conversation he had with President Wickremesinghe as told by the latter in his condolence message.â€ â€œRanil do you think I would ever advocate for dividing our country? I witnessed our Independence in 1948 as a childâ€. This just about sums up the man and what indeed he stood for as a Sri Lankan.\nThe post An irreplaceable Tamil Leader appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-07-03','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/04/editorial/581388/an-irreplaceable-tamil-leader/'),(32,'Education should not be disturbed or delayed','It is very interesting to check the current situation of some of the present day schoolteachers who teach at state schools. They are more interested in everything else than teaching. Even when they teach, they teach children about the importance of doing Aragalaya and the hardships they face justifying their trade union actions. Most of the time they do this through various WhatsApp groups of children created for study purposes. Now they have become brave enough to do it in live classrooms in state schools. Those are their interests. They are not interested in teaching which they get paid.\nLast week President Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed that no one would be permitted to disrupt school education between 7.30 am and 1.30 pm and he has directed the Attorney General to consider further measures to ensure this. â€œIt is imperative that the education of children is not hindered by school closures or strikes. Our actions must be taken with future generations in mindâ€, he added. Present day teachers are only worried about their private tuition classes.\nSometimes they punish or ignore poor students who do not attend their private tuition classes. The best part is not any of those. They never teach in schools during school time. They do their own work or just rest in the `staff roomâ€™ chatting with other teachers. Most of the teachers just read the lesson and put the answers for questions on the black / white board. This practice becomes a tragedy when it comes to teaching Mathematics. The other major issue is that the majority of teachers only teach the good (talented) students while totally ignoring all the other students who have average ability and are weak.\nIn state schools, the students are rarely allowed to ask questions and get things clarified when they face difficulties while learning. Asking questions is treated as â€˜going against the teacherâ€™ or â€˜putting the teacher in a difficult situationâ€™. Some students were promoted to the next grade without teaching them how to read and write! They reach Grade Ten without knowing how to read and write. Only schoolchildren in all Provinces except North and East are affected by teachersâ€™ strikes. Others and International and private school children are NOT affected at all. It is poor schoolchildren at the receiving end.\nIt is good that at least schoolteachers can prevent such schoolchildren from becoming criminals. To do this the teachers should understand that their service is `sacredâ€™ and NOT just another job done for the monthly salary. They can very easily learn this from retired (aged) schoolteachers. No matter what, Sri Lankan adults respect their schoolteachers. They do especially after finishing schooling and becoming adults. They bow down and worship their school teachers even on public roads ! That era is no more.\nLate last year it was reported that around 6000 students failed all subjects in the Ordinary Level Examination. They were not idiots. They had not been given required knowledge by teachers. But some teachers are good at one thing. That is using schoolchildrenâ€™s personal details (their parentsâ€™ jobs, casts, financial status, religions etc) when scolding them for minor offences. Those schoolteachers cannot be named as school. Their formal attire is extremely pathetic. They wear sarees to school but those so-called sarees are more like bikinis! They expose every possible part of their bodies through the saree. They think that the school is a fashion show ramp and schoolchildren are the audience!\nPresent day teachers try their best to get anything and everything from schoolchildren. Gifts, money, etc are among those things but the list does not end there. The list ends with sexual satisfaction. It is not only male teachers and principals. It is the same with female schoolteachers. Maybe still Sri Lankan people remember how an old female schoolteacher from Horana area sexually abused a young schoolboy at his own home. Several years ago another female schoolteacher eloped with a 15-years-old school boy and was found from Nuwara Eliya by the Police after a few days.\nNow the time has come for the teachersâ€™ trade unions to stop all strikes and find out their own members who exploit schoolchildren. Maybe they can establish a mechanism to trace them, investigate them and punish them. But detecting, investigating and punishing the culprits should not be similar to doing it in the health sector! In the health sector, at the end of any investigation, there are no culprits and therefore no punishments. It is similar to asking who the robber is from the mother of the thief!\nIt is very important for any human being to achieve whatever he/she wants without wasting any time. Wasting even one second from a childâ€™s life is a crime. It is a crime because we cannot turn back our biological clock. We cannot take back the time wasted. All individuals and groups who committed this crime should be punished by law. Crocodile tears of teachersâ€™ trade unions are not useful for schoolchildren.\nÂ \nThe post Education should not be disturbed or delayed appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-07-07','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/08/editorial/583386/education-should-not-be-disturbed-or-delayed/'),(33,'A good move','Todayâ€™s topic is relevant for the entire population, especially the ordinary people above the age of 50 or 60, who suffer from Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and all the other illnesses. For some individuals medications matter more than food and they are on certain medications for the rest of their lives. Only the people who suffer some type of disease know the value of reducing sky high prices of drugs. There should be transparency and fairness in the pricing of locally produced and imported pharmaceuticals.\nThe National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Act, No. 5 of 2015, was amended and the gazette notification related to the matter was also published in order to introduce a price mechanism to determine the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of medicinal drugs. The initiative had been taken to ensure fairness and transparency in pharmaceutical pricing.\nA method was introduced to determine the MRP of a particular drug, considering its dosage, form and strength. Accordingly, regulations were issued to be cited as the â€œMedicines (Pricing Mechanism for determination of MRP for a dosage, form and strength of a particular medicine) Regulations, No. 1 of 2024.â€\nThe MRP of a dosage, form and strength of a particular medicine â€œshould be determined by using an internationally recognised information portal for identifying the market share by value of different brands or Generic Names of drug formulations. The MRP would be determined by verifying the retail costs of the relevant dosage, form and strength of a particular medicine from retail pharmacies in different parts of the island and information provided by the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC).\nThe prices of almost all medications, especially the medications used by people who suffer from NCDs skyrocketed along with the depreciation of the Rupee against the Dollar and even rich people could not afford to buy medications from private pharmacies after the gravest ever financial crisis hit Sri Lanka in 2022. The ordinary people suffered a lot for about two years without being able to buy medications.\nSome people totally gave up buying the medications prescribed to them by their physicians and some people reduced the number of times they take their regular medications. For example they stopped taking their prescribed medications daily and they took those medications every other day. Some started to use the medications only when they feel sick and some started to use medications only when they have some money to buy those expensive medications.\nIt was the countryâ€™s workforce which was severely affected by all those practices. The overall health of the country was at risk. Some poor people even started to use Ayurvedic or herbal medications after giving up extremely expensive Western medications prescribed for them. They did it because they did not have any other option after meeting all the other requirements of their families, especially their childrenâ€™s food requirements etc.\nThis situation made peopleâ€™s health worse because they were very worried without being able to buy essential medications that control their diseases and save their lives. No one likes to stop using medications without his/her Physicianâ€™s instructions because almost everyone knows that it is not safe. Only the people who use at least one or two medications regularly for their illnesses know the plight of not being able to buy medications and healthy people who do not use any medications do not understand this silent suffering.\nWith measures taken in June 2023 and yesterday to reduce prices of drugs, all the people who can afford will buy their regular medications from pharmacies without seeking the service of State hospitals where they can receive their regular drugs free of charge. Usually no one likes to go to clinics in State hospitals and wait in queues for hours in order to obtain their medications. Therefore, people who have some money in their hands will buy their medications from the private sector.\nBut in the past even the people who worked in the private sector and earned a reasonable salary did not have adequate money to buy their regular medications because they had to pay over Rs. 10,000 to buy medications they need just for one week. Before the financial crisis they just paid around Rs. 1,000 for the same amount of medications.\nThe prices of several medicines were revised by way of an extraordinary gazette issued in June 2023 enabling people to buy drugs for lower prices. Accordingly, the prices of 60 medicines were reduced by 16 percent as per the relevant gazette. Insulin, Thyroxin, Olanzapine are among the drugs subjected to the MRP reduction of 16 percent.\nThe introduction of maximum prices for certain medications such as Insulin and Thyroxin was very significant because a large number of people use them. A large number of people, especially those above 40 use Thyroxin which is an essential hormone because unlike in the past a significant portion of the population suffer from hormonal deficiencies. The health authorities should also tame the private health sector, especially private hospitals which still charge sky-high prices for diagnostic tests, medications and in-patient treatment. A uniform pricing policy should be introduced at least for the diagnostic and radiological tests.\nThe post A good move appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-07-04','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/05/editorial/582119/a-good-move/'),(34,'Teaching Profession hits a New Low','Government teachers and principals who have so far been staging street demonstrations over their salary demands have taken their protests to a new levelâ€”doing so opposite schools where they earn their keep, thus reaching a new low in their continuing shameful and unacceptable conduct unbecoming of a noble profession.\nThe teacher-principal trade union members yesterday were shown carrying black flags and banners opposite schools, shouting slogans demanding redress for their grievances. They are also planning to co-opt parents to join their protest campaign by taking up cudgels with the Government over alleged financial burdens placed on parents, in a clear bid to mobilize the parents to side with them (teachers) in order to win their salary demands.\nGeneral Secretary of the Ceylon Teachersâ€™ Services Union (CTSU) Mahinda Jayasinghe said the teachers and principals had held their demonstrations after school hours. However, he had failed to grasp the moral and ethical aspect of the whole issue. Here, we have a group of teachers, teaching at the same schools for a living, turning their backs on this very fact, falling prey to greed by staging demonstrations in front of the very schools they teach. What message are they hoping to convey to the public, particularly the parents? Above all, what implications is their act going to have on the conduct of the very students whom they are not only responsible for educating but also providing with the necessary guidance and character building to one day be productive and responsible citizens of this country? Are we going to witness a scenario where the students too very soon are going to stage demonstrations in front of their schools at the drop of a hat? Who can blame them when their own mentors and guardians have shown them the way? What, pray, is going to happen to discipline, which is a paramount feature in school life? How are the education authorities going to respond to this state of affairs? Will this not cause the collapse of the whole edifice of the education sector; what with teachers not only absenting themselves from schools to stage demonstrations but also laying siege on the very schools that provide them with their livelihoods? Where do we go from here?\nMeanwhile, parents should not allow themselves to be used in this fashion by the teachers who are only driven by political motives, as could be seen by the identity of the leaders of the teacher strikes. They have no interest whatsoever in the future of the student population. We say this because strikes by the teaching community were unheard of in the past. They (teachers) worked devotedly to ensure a bright future for their charges and were even willing to work for low salaries. This attitude won for them the respect and regard of all citizens who even went to the teachers for advice and counsel. The teachers and principals were held in such high esteem. What a contrast with the present, where the teaching community, as a whole, has lowered itself to the level of a run-of-the-mill trade union. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the other day, declared that he was going to make the teaching profession an essential service. Teachers who boycott school should be sacked and replacements found to fill in the breach. Students cannot be allowed to be held to ransom in this manner. Teachers have already received one-third of their promised 30 percent salary hike. They should wait until the economy has turned healthy for the remainder. Giving teachers a pay hike at this moment is certainly going to open the floodgates with a whole host of state sector bodies clamoring for salary hikes, which will send the economy into a tailspin and cause a setback in the progress that is being achieved.\nThere is no gainsaying that the teachers have brought disgrace to this once noble profession by their unseemly conduct. It is now left to the few teachers who are above board to try and restore the prestige of their profession, which has been dealt a body blow by the behaviour and conduct of their fellow colleagues. The Government, for its part, should bring in laws to ban all teachersâ€™ trade unions, which are nothing but appendages of politically driven trade unions in other sectors. Teachers should demonstrate by example that they deserve all demands they make by first devoting their time and energies to the development and advancement of the student population. We say this because, as already mentioned, teachers hold a special place in society not only for their education and erudition but also for their role as guiding lights to the younger generation. In their hands lay the future of the young, and they should strive to reflect this through their conduct. They (teachers) cannot be unaware that the economic crisis has exerted extreme difficulties on the Government in managing its finances, and cost-cutting even in vital sectors is being resorted to, not forgetting the poor relief programmes it has launched to cater to the vulnerable sections. Government has also to adhere to the conditions stipulated by the IMF for receiving assistance, the chief of which is pruning down Government expenditure. Across-the-board pay hikes, therefore, are not an option at this stage.\nThe post Teaching Profession hits a New Low appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-07-02','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/03/editorial/580704/teaching-profession-hits-a-new-low/'),(35,'Book by Sri Lankan in world illustration awards longlist','A book by a Sri Lankan has been included in the longlist of the World Illustration Awards, a global competition for illustrators.\nThe cover of â€˜Jungle of the Jungleâ€™ by Sam Weerawardane was entered into the Book Covers category through a bursary scheme.\nThe book is amongst 500 artists selected from over 5000 entries for the World Illustration Awards longlist.\nâ€œIâ€™m excited to see it alongside some truly stunning work.

While other captains fled from the iceberg, we faced a critical decision: sink or navigate to safety. Now that weâ€™ve reached port, the question is what to do next with this ship. We must decide whether to refurbish it for the next 50-100 years or hand it over in its current state to a fleeing captain.â€\nRegarding the implementation of external debt restructuring agreements, President Wickremesinghe will make a special statement to Parliament today. The debate on the Resolution for the Implementation of External Debt Restructuring Agreements will commence at 9:30 am and continue until 5:00 pm today and tomorrow. The parliamentary vote on this resolution is scheduled for 5:00 pm tomorrow.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe also announced that Sri Lanka will seek parliamentary approval for these agreements on July 2. These agreements allow Sri Lanka to defer repayment to its bilateral creditors until 2028 and extend the repayment period up to 2043.\nThe finalisation of these deals was a crucial condition set by the IMF under a $2.9 billion bailout program signed in March 2023. This programme has been instrumental in helping Sri Lanka tame inflation, stabilise its currency, and improve government finances. Projections indicate that Sri Lankaâ€™s economy is poised to grow by 3% in 2024, rebounding from a 2.3% contraction the previous year.\nThe approval of the resolution for the Implementation of External Debt Restructuring Agreements now rests with the 225 parliamentarians elected by the people of Sri Lanka. It is imperative that they vote in accordance with the wishes of their constituents rather than the directives of party leaders. It has become evident that while the Sri Lankan people desire one outcome, the political party leadership often leans towards the opposite.\nSri Lankans typically have a sharp memory for hardships endured, such as the queues and shortages experienced in 2022. They remember vividly who stood up for them during those challenging times. This collective memory influences their decisions, often prioritising practical experience over rhetoric.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe has not just spoken but has acted decisively. His courageous decisions, despite harsh criticism, have significantly reduced the cost of living, with prices of essentials like fuel, gas, and electricity plummeting. This tangible relief resonates deeply with the populace, who are inclined to support leadership that delivers on promises.\nHowever, manoeuvring the political landscape in this land is a complex affair. Entrenched interests often resist change. Despite the positive momentum, challenges remain. It reflects the nationâ€™s tumultuous journey.\nThe deterioration of the shipâ€™s condition was orchestrated by pirates who continually attacked and plundered it over time. Unable to seize the ship directly due to its strength, the pirates resorted to tactics like using so-called â€œtrade unionistsâ€ and a disruptive process called â€œAragalayaâ€ to weaken it. They also propagated falsehoods and undermined every captain who took command, leading many to capitulate to their schemes. However, the people have grown weary of these tactics and strongly oppose the pirates.\nAs of May 2024, Sri Lankaâ€™s Gross Official Reserves stood at USD 5.4 billion, marking a significant increase of over USD 1 billion from the previous year-end. Based on inflation forecasts, average consumer price inflation is projected to be 3.1% in 2024 and 2.0% in 2025, a notable decrease from 4.06% in 2023 and 9.59% in 2022. The Sri Lankan Rupee is anticipated to strengthen against the US Dollar by the end of 2024, with the LKR/USD rate expected to reach $0.003112. Furthermore, the interest rate, which peaked at 28% in 2023, has now dropped to a single-digit figure.\nDespite a 3.7% budget primary deficit in 2022, Sri Lanka achieved a remarkable turnaround in 2023, achieving a primary budget surplus. This achievement, the sixth instance in the 76 years since independence, is a significant milestone. In 2022, the balance of payments deficit was 1.9% of GDP, but by the end of 2023, the country managed to achieve a surplus, a feat not seen since 1977.\nMoreover, the governmentâ€™s 52 main statutory bodies, which faced a loss of Rs. 745 billion by the end of 2022, turned a profit of Rs. 313 billion by September 2023, surpassing expectations. The people eagerly await the storm in October, ready to entrust the ship to the captain who saved it from turmoil and uncertainty.\nThe post Turning the Tide appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-07-01','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/02/editorial/579815/turning-the-tide/'),(37,'A long overdue step','President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday asserted that he would be forced to declare teaching an Essential Service (ES) if teachers continue to engage in their agitations. In an audience with the Most Ven. Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates in Kandy on Thursday, the President emphasized the need for teachers to be present in the schools during school hours for the education of the nationâ€™s children.\nHe noted that since 2022 teachers received a salary increase ranging from Rs.13,000 to Rs 27,000 adding that other Government servants too had to be considered. He also noted that strike actions of the teachers were confined to only Sinhala medium schools while commending the Tamil, Muslim and private schools for ensuring an uninterrupted education for children.\nThe Presidentâ€™s move to declare the teaching profession as an ES, was long overdue, given the frequency with which teachers took to the streets giving no consideration for the future of their charges. Soon after the Presidentâ€™s declaration, Teacher Trade Union front-man Joseph Stalin rejected the idea saying they would not abide by the ruling and would continue their agitations if the teacher salary demand went unanswered.\nPerhaps, the main reason for the arrogance of the trade unionists in this instance, no doubt, stemmed from the failure of the authorities to give effect to the ES regulations in real terms. Thus far, the Emergency Regulations decree had been applied to many service sectors such as the railways, postal services, ports etc. during strikes. However, no sooner things returned to normal, the miscreants always went scot free, the ES decree notwithstanding.\nThis is mainly due to the political backing enjoyed by these trade unions and the knowledge that they are certain to be bailed out through political intervention. Hence, ES regulations had so far lacked teeth, which is the reason for the strikers to ignore them so far.\nThis situation must change. The decree that those who continued to engaged in strike action when ES had been declared, is deemed to have vacated post should be implemented to the letter. There can be no compromise in this respect. The spate of strikes that now has become all too common must be brought to an end. The economy which is just beginning to show a revival cannot afford the luxury of serial strike action.\nThat the ES regulation is to be brought to bear on the teaching profession is indeed a telling indictment on the present day teachers who have not only sullied their own reputations but also that of their noble profession. The Presidentâ€™s decision in this regard, one would agree, is well justified considering the implications the spate of teacher strikes are going to have on the future generation. Are we going to experience a scenario similar to that which has hit our universities which are closed more often than not? Are the children attending private and International schools going to steal an advantage over that of their counterparts in State run schools which operate only in fits and starts due to the on-going teacher strikes?\nHarsh measures are called for to deal with the errant teachers whose priority which ought to be the education of students has now been replaced with greed and selfishness. They no longer deserve the honour and regard accorded to the teaching profession in the past. In that bygone era teachers and Principals were held in such high esteem that ordinary folk sought their counsel even on personal matters. The Loku Iskoley Mahattaya (School Principal) in the village was a much sought after figure for advice and guidance.\nWhat a contrast with the present where the teaching community as a whole have lost all regard and honour and descended to this sorry pass. The Government should not give in to the unreasonable demands of the teachersâ€™ unions. As the President noted, this could open the floodgates at a time all efforts are being made to stabilize the economy. Under the circumstances, the only way granting salary increases across the board could be made possible is by printing money on which the IMF has imposed a strict taboo. Even with the printing of money, salary increases to teachers would be a meaningless exercise with the devaluation of money due to inflation. The teachers more than other segments ought to understand this reality instead of insisting on their pound of flesh at whatever cost.\nThe teachers and principals should be shown where to get off. Their lot has been having things their own way for far too long. Teachers who boycott school should be sacked under ES laws and replacements found to fill in the breach. Students cannot be allowed to be held to ransom in this manner. Besides, the violent conduct of the teachers, including female teachers, who were seen engaging in fierce battles with the Police, does not bode well for the profession. It is a clear indication that they no longer deserve respect and preferential treatment owing to the nature of their profession. The full brunt of the ES regulations should be brought to bear on them.\nThe post A long overdue step appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-06-28','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/06/29/editorial/578425/a-long-overdue-step-3/'),(38,'Ruwanthie de Chickera launches The Children of the Little Olive Park','\nBy Sarah Hannan\nSri Lankans are taking a keen interest on expressing their solidarity with the people of Palestine since the 07 October 2023 events and recently organised an event that reflected on the first Nakba that took place on 14 May 1948 under the theme â€˜All Out for Palestineâ€™.\nAmong the many variety items that were on the days agenda was the book â€˜The Children of the Little Olive Parkâ€™Â authored by Ruwanthie de Chickera andÂ illustrated by Ryan Holsinger. The book distributed free at the event was dramatised by actors from Mind Adventures Theatre Co. and Stages Theatre Group actors.\nâ€œI wrote it in such a way that even a child could understand how the conflict was created in Palestine, and how it has been stoked throughout the years to bring about this terrible situation we are in,â€ speaking about the book de Chickera explained.\nThe illustrations done by Holsinger add aÂ greaterÂ visual impact for those who pick the book to read to children. ChildrenÂ who areÂ familiar with the colours associated with the countries could visually read the story along with it.\nWhen asked on why she decided to use a situation between children for her storytelling approach, de Chickera elaborated; â€œIn this little story, the main points of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict are set in simple language, and applied to a childrenâ€™s situation. Two groups of children fight over a small park that they both want to play in. What would any decent and sensible adult do to mediate a situation like this? If the answer is clear in this scenario, the answer in Palestine should be clear too.â€\ndeÂ Chickeraâ€™sÂ approach to explaining the complexity of an over seven-decade systematic pogrom andÂ marginalisationÂ endured by the people of Palestine isÂ simple,Â it talks about a daily occurrence of a simple interaction between two groups that have to access a public space and share resources. While on the surface level, this seems like a social engagement that will not causeÂ anyÂ conflict or create division, de Chickera unties the intricate details of how a simple behaviour of selfishness, wanting to impose authority and ownership based on access toÂ resourcesÂ could lead to disputes.\nCollaborative effort and a drama\nde Chickera fondly remembered her long term peer in theatre practice Tracy Holsinger who is the Director of Mind Adventures Theatre Co. with whom de Chickeraâ€™s Stages Theatre Group actors collaborated to stage a key moment of the story at the Public Library on 14 May 2024.\nâ€œTracy created a fantastic play. Both Mind Adventures Theatre Co. and Stages Theatre Group are local theatre companies, which have been around for 25 years now, producing original and innovative theatre on pertinent social issues. Like artists the world over, we have been horrified by the carnage in Palestine and the hypocritical brutality of powerful Western governments and global institutions set up to â€˜protectâ€™ humanity,â€ de Chickera explained.\nAdding that, â€œSince November 2023, we have been consolidating the efforts of activists in Sri Lanka in support of the global movement towards a free Palestine. We have produced poetry, music, performances, and readings in solidarity with the people of Palestine and in support to end all colonization, apartheid, genocide and hypocrisy. As artists, we will continue to lend our efforts to this global struggle for humanity.â€\nSome views from the readers of â€˜The Children of the Little Olive Parkâ€™\nCost of conflict â€“ 12-year-old Sarah\n12-year-old Sarah SurajÂ whoÂ is an avid readerÂ upon readingÂ theÂ bookÂ said that overallÂ theÂ book captures theÂ â€˜Cost ofÂ Conflictâ€™\nâ€œThe Children of the Little Olive Parkâ€Â is a storyÂ thatÂ isÂ inspiredÂ by the fight between Palestine and Israel; it talks about a crucial aspect of the conflict and creates awareness of the ongoing war. It shows us the ignorance surrounding theÂ conflict,Â andÂ how most of the world overlooks it for itsÂ convenience;Â even though many innocent livesÂ are taken away.Â  The story also tells us of the suffering endured byÂ Palestinians,Â despite their generosity to Israel. This story talks about the war through simple andÂ interestingÂ storytelling.\nâ€œThe Little Olive Parkâ€Â is more than just a story; it is a reminder of the cost of conflict. It amplifies the voices silenced by the world. I enjoyed reading this book, and I think it has a meaningful andÂ deepÂ messageÂ allÂ while being short and simple.â€\nWhy did theÂ bigÂ place people do such things? â€“ 10 year old Imaad\n10-year-old Imaad HannanÂ whoÂ read the book with his mom Tinaz AmithÂ wasÂ quite confused as to why theÂ bigÂ place people ill-treated the children living near the Little Olive Park. Amith explained that her son understood that the story was about the conflict that is taking place in Palestine, yetÂ neededÂ more information about the history of the conflict toÂ understandÂ why they needed to divide the park between the two groups.\nâ€œImaad did not understand why things were happening as in the storyÂ at first. He did not know the history of the conflict between the two countries. He knew it was aboutÂ Palestine,Â but could not understand why the big place people did such things. Once I explained the history, he understood it clearly.â€\n\nCollect a FreeÂ copy at Barefoot Bookshop, Colombo 03, Sri Lanka\nDownload the book through â€“https://archive.org/details/little-olive-park-mobile-version\n\n(Sarah Hannan is a media practitioner, consultant trainer, mentor specialising in the field of print media.

Some 80 plus Government teachersâ€™ trade unions yesterday pulled out their members for the second day running over the alleged failure by the Government to meet their salary demands.Â  This has now become a very familiar scenario and should be viewed with the seriousness it deserves by the authorities.\nAfter all, what is at stake is the future of the countryâ€™s student population. Yesterdayâ€™s strike action by the teachers coincided withÂ  the beginning of evaluation of the GCE O/L answer scripts. But for the teachers this was furthest from their minds. All that they were interested in was extracting their pound of flesh.\nTeachers going on strike for whatever reason is a relatively new phenomenon. In the past, teachers devoted their time and energy towards their primary duty of preparing their charges for the future by imparting knowledge but also for making them responsible citizens who will go on to serve the Motherland with honour and distinction. They had no time for any other pursuits and were quite satisfied by what they received in terms of emoluments.\nAlas, the present lot is indeed an insult to their counterparts of that different era and have only brought shame and insult to their noble profession. Yesterday, students were shown on TV arriving at their schools only to be turned away at the entrance by security staff. The students told the interviewers that they were not informed of a teachersâ€™ strike beforehand, and hence came to school as usual. This while the teachers were engaged in fierce battles with the Police on the streets and being subject to water cannon and teargas blasts. Some of the teachers even turned violent with some among them shown on TV hurling stones and other missiles at the Police. This is in sharp contrast to the primary task of teachers â€“ teaching and veering students away from all forms of violence.\nThe reason for the teachers to go on strike for a second day according to Trade Union frontman Joseph Stalin was due to the Police tear-gassing teachers on earlier occasions. In other words the teachers have seen it fit to take it out on the students for what, after all, was Police action to uphold the rule of law.Â  How can any reasonable mind not comprehend this? One must also take note that the teachers staged their strike action in defiance of Court orders preventing them from entering certain areas in order to facilitate traffic movement. This is tantamount to teachers going on to snub the law which is contrary to what, one imagines, is taught in the classrooms viz. obedienceÂ  to the law.\nIn a bygone era, teachers and principals were held in such high esteem that they were invariably invited by the villagers to get through the first phases of a childâ€™s life by helping the child with the alphabet. The Loku Iskoley Mahattaya (School Principal) in the village was a much sought after figure for advice and guidance and considered as an oracle.\nWhat a contrast with the present where the teaching community, as a whole, have lowered themselves to the level of just another trade union holding demonstrations and staging protests near the Fort Railway station and the Lipton Circus. The Government should not give itself into the demands and declare the teaching profession an Essential Service. Teachers who boycott school should be sacked and replacements found to fill in the breach. Students cannot be allowed to be held to ransom in this manner.\nTeachers and Principals should be shown where to get off. They have been having things their own way for too long. Present day teachers and Principals are only interested in amassing wealth. The Media reported recently how a school Principal in a remote village was arrested by the Police for engaging in the moonshine (kasippu) business at his home. Instances were also reported where teachers engaged in private tuition had sexually abused their charges. Such conduct by the teachers was unheard of in the past. Today the teachers have brought disgrace to this once noble profession by their unbecoming conduct. It is now left to the few teachers who are above board to try and restore the prestige of their profession which has been dealt a body blow by the behaviour and conduct of their fellow colleagues.\nThe Government for its part should bring in laws to ban all teachers trade unions which are nothing but appendages of extremist political groups. The participation of such party representatives in the teachersâ€™ strikes in the past bears this out.Â  Teachers should demonstrate by example that they deserve all demands they make by first devoting their time and energies for the development and advancement of the student population.\nWe say this because, as already mentioned, teachers hold a special place in society not only for their education and erudition but also their role as guiding lights to the younger generation. In their hands lie the future of the young and they should strive to reflect this through exemplary conduct.\nÂ \nThe post Huge slur on a noble profession appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-06-27','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/06/28/editorial/577951/huge-slur-on-a-noble-profession/'),(42,'Resolve pension anomalies','P\nublic Servants serve the country for several decades and then retire. A pension paid to them recognizing their service rendered to the country. But what if someone obtains his/her motherâ€™s/fatherâ€™s or both parentsâ€™ pension(s) illegally? It is not acceptable at all.\nLast week, the media reported that over 6,400 Sri Lankans obtain illegal pensions of other individuals. The information was revealed during a recent COPE meeting. Another revelation was that an individual had obtained nearly 2.7 million as pension payments from 2013 to 2016 and it was the two pensions of that specific individualâ€™s dead parents. Most of the additional pensions had been paid to various individuals connected to the Armed Forces.\nSri Lankan public servants receive pensions for the service they rendered to the country. They serve for low salaries when compared with other countries in the world and then retire after serving for three or more decades. Then they face the biggest challenge of their life because their pensions are not paid to them in the very next month after they retire. They become jobless and have no income at all.\nAbout three or four decades ago it took more than three or four years to pay the pension for the public servants who retired and sometimes they did not live to receive their first pension. But this situation gradually changed and this `dark waiting periodâ€™ without any income was reduced to three or two years and then one or two years. At the moment usually it takes a few months. Even now some public servants need to wait for several months to get their first pension and sometimes they get it within a few months. Some public servants who handle this service delay some pensions purposely due to jealousy etc.\nMany Sri Lankans are cunning and it is their nature. Once the mother/father or both parents pass away, the children continue to obtain their pensions. This happens due to the lack of general knowledge and ignorance of public servants who handle various parts of the pension. First, it is the Department of Pensions. Then comes the Divisional Secretariat of the specific area where the pensioner has lived. The Grama Niladhari of the specific Grama Niladhari Division where the pensioner lived is also responsible and it is his/her duty to certify whether the relevant pensioner is still alive or dead.\nOtherwise, the children of the dead pensioners will continue to obtain pensions without any problem and it happens when the pension directly goes to the bank account of the pensioner. The children can very easily withdraw the pension from the ATM of the relevant bank even without the knowledge of a living and permanently disabled or mentally sick pensioner. This is the ground reality of Sri Lanka. It is a little bit difficult when the pensioners go to the Post Office, sign and obtain the pension. Even then the children can get the dead parentsâ€™ pensions without any trouble because they are extremely familiar with the Sub Post Office of their village and usually they get the signature of their parents, go to the post office and get the pension because the staffers of the sub-post office are familiar with the villagers.\nWhat is required is a proper monitoring system and tracking system. This can be very easily established through Grama Niladharis. At the moment they only check whether the relevant pensioner is living or dead only when they need to certify the free railway Warrants issued to all pensioners annually. Not all pensioners use those free warrants because most of the pensioners are old, sick and unable to travel by train. Only a few pensioners use one or two sets of warrants.\nAt the moment the children are eligible to receive their parentsâ€™ pensions only if they are permanently disabled, mentally retarded etc and it should be certified by a Medical Board. Otherwise male children receive the pension until they turn 18 and female children receive the pension until they turn 21 or get married. The pension ceases if female children get married before the age of 21. If not they receive it until they turn 21. It is the same with Widowâ€™s & Orphanâ€™s Pension (W&OP). These are the current rules and regulations of paying a pension to Sri Lankan citizens.\nUsually Sri Lankan public servants retire at the age of 60 and by that time they have children around the age of 30. Therefore usually children above the age of 30 do not need pensions from their parents because they can easily work and earn a living. Only the children who are permanently disabled, mentally retarded etc need parentsâ€™ assistance to live. Therefore it is the sole responsibility of all relevant officials, State Departments, and Public Servants to implement the existing law strictly in order to stop illegal pensions and prevent such pension payments in the future.\nThe Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) is a Parliamentary Committee established on July 21, 1979, by the Parliament of Sri Lanka. Whatever information revealed by this committee should be treated seriously because it is all about public money collected through taxes.\nÂ \nThe post Resolve pension anomalies appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-06-30','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/01/editorial/579075/resolve-pension-anomalies/'),(43,'ANCL grabs five awards at Asia Miracle awards','The Associated Newspaper of Ceylon Limited secured five awards at the Asia Miracle awards.\nFollowing are the awards received by the ANCL\n\nService Excellence AwardÂ  (Manoj Abeydheera â€“ Editor Dinamina)\nBest Tamil News Digital Platform of the Year 2024 (Thinakaran.lk)\nBest Business News Editor (Shirajiv Sirimanne â€“ Daily news)\nBest YouTube channel for Sinhala Newspaper of the year 2024 (Dinamina Youtube)\nBest Facebook channel for movie news of the year 2024 (Sarasaviya Facebook)\n\n \nThe post ANCL grabs five awards at Asia Miracle awards appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-06-02','Entertainment','https://www.dailynews.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1000087450-300x175.jpg','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/06/02/entertainment/561990/ancl-grabs-five-awards-at-asia-miracle-awards/'),(44,'LUX SARASAVIYA FILM AWARDS FETES CINEMATIC EXCELLENCE','The 35th Lux Sarasaviya Film Awards organized by the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (Lake House) was held at the BMICH yesterday night.

The magnitude of this achievement is underscored by the rarity of such accolades in the highly competitive music industry.\nCeline Dion, who has battled a rare neurological disorder, made a surprise appearance to present Swift with the coveted award. Dionâ€™s triumphant return to the stage was met with a warm reception from the audience, underscoring the resilience and enduring spirit of music icons.\nSwift, known for her ability to surprise and captivate, did not disappoint her fans at the ceremony. In a move that sent shockwaves through the music community, she announced the release of a new album during the event. The news left fans eagerly anticipating another chapter in Swiftâ€™s illustrious career.\nWhile Swiftâ€™s achievements took centre stage, other notable artistes also claimed their share of the spotlight. Miley Cyrus, with her soulful anthem Flowers, secured Record of the Year, showcasing her versatility as an artiste. Billie Eilish, no stranger to Grammy success, was honored with Song of the Year for What Was I Made For?.\nThe Grammy Awards saw a strong representation of women, with R&B luminaries SZA and Victoria MonÃ©t, along with the all-female indie supergroup Boygenius, receiving multiple awards. Tracy Chapman and Joni Mitchell delivered rare and poignant performances, reminding the audience of the enduring power of iconic voices in the industry.\nHowever, the night was not without its share of controversy. Killer Mike, the top male winner of the evening with three rap trophies, found himself in the midst of an apparent backstage altercation, resulting in him being â€œbooked for misdemeanor battery,â€ according to LA police.\nSwift, in her acceptance speech, emphasized her deep love for the creative process, stating, â€œFor me, the award is the work.â€ She shared her equal appreciation for simple moments in her musical journey, emphasizing the joy derived from finishing a song, rehearsing, or preparing for a show. Swiftâ€™s humility and passion for music resonated with fans and fellow artistes alike.\nExpressing gratitude for the award, Swift acknowledged the happiness it brings not only to herself but also to those who voted for her. Her previous victories in the Album of the Year category for Fearless (2010), 1989 (2016), and Folklore (2021) paved the way for her historic win with Midnights.\nDespite her triumphs, Swift has yet to secure awards for Song or Record of the Year, highlighting the depth of competition in these categories.

This worth-watching exhibition will continue until February 25 at Lionel Wendt and invites you to connect with the beauty of the artistic soul while embarking on a journey through boundless realms of creativity.\nProfound beauty of KALÄ€ is regarded as South Asiaâ€™s maiden educational and artistic platform. Curated by KALÄ€ assistant Mariyam Begum under the guidance of KALÄ€ Curatorial Advisor Sandhini Poddar, Adjunct Curator at Large of the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, â€˜Pivot Glide Echoâ€™ undoubtedly serves as a source of inspiration for artists. Needless to mention that KALÄ€ is a golden opportunity for both artists and art lovers in our country.\nWhen I stepped into the KALÄ€ exhibition, I found myself being carried away by a plethora of artistic expressions. The arrangement of each piece of artwork spontaneously guides the viewers on a seamless trajectory towards a symphony of creativity. Synergy between light and shadow enhances the visual impact of creations, captivating the viewersâ€™ eyes. Indeed, breathing stories depicted in artworks have the power to transport the viewers to various eras from the colonial period to the modern era. Artistsâ€™ brushstrokes, uncovering their own interpretations of reality through their creations, serve as a testament to their endless sensitivity, commitment, and masterful brilliance.\nThe soundtrack of the heart-soothing music woven into the atmosphere blended with serenity contributes to sensory enrichment.\nWhat holds true is the fact that KALÄ€ bridges the chasm between artworks and the audience, weaving a tapestry of creativity, emotions, artistic expressions, and shared experiences. To be honest, the distance and boundaries between creations and visitors blur into obscurity. As an art lover, I myself felt that most visitors had become a part of the exhibition naturally. Some visitors were deeply moved, while others were pausing before certain artworks. Their eyes glued to the breathing canvases disclosed their curiosity, passion, and love for artworks.

Earlier also the JVP had tried to destabilise the country on several occasions in the hope of political gains.\nHe stated that it is reasonable to increase salaries by certain amounts even though strikes due to the existing high cost of living, but the Government has already requested all these parties to wait until the upcoming Budget to take such a step.\nHowever, he said, various parties are engaged in strikes without paying attention to such a request and it is clear that their attempt is to destabilise the country by paralysing the public sector.\nThe MP also requested all strikers to elect NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake as the next President and take steps to increase the salaries if possible.\nHe said that nearly 500,000 public servants are involved in the strikes going on yesterday and today, and it is obvious that the JVP is behind these strikes and their only intention is to destabilise the country.\nAluthgamage emphasised that if a salary increase of Rs. 20,000 is given to public servants as requested by several trade unions that are on strike now, the Treasury will have to bear an additional cost of Rs. 400 billion per year.\nHe said there are 1.6 million public servants, but the Treasury does not have the ability to allocate such a large amount and even if the amount is allocated, the alternative is to print money, raise taxes or borrow, he said.\nHe further pointed out that at this time it is not possible to print or borrow money.

The first three matches we couldnâ€™t win but our batters did well and bowlers had few issues and restricting opponents below 200 runs on this type of wicket always a plus point to win the game. We restricted Colombo team for 185 at Dambulla wicket and that was a good achievement on this type of surface. After I got a century in previous game against Jaffna Kings at Pallekele once again made match winning 80 in the last game against Colombo Strikers at Dambulla. Both myself and my opening partner Reza Hendrikas intention was always attack the ball during the power play and then continue innings and easy to find the gaps to make runs and that really worked out said Kusal He is having fastest LPL century record this time while his aggressive mood during power play is big challenge for opponent bowlers.\nGalle Marvels all rounder Isuru Udana in action\nIn fact Kusal Perera was not sold at the LPL auction earlier finally got chance to enter Dambulla Sixes. He is now in top form and this wicket keeper and left hand batter is playing an important role for Dambulla Sixes. They have three more matches and already in fourth place with 2 points after losing three matches and they wanted to repeat performance to get wins to go forward.\nOur skipper Mohammed Nabi is a veteran in this white ball format and give good freedom to all players while our supporting staff headed by Rangana Herath and mentor Roshan Mahanama give good support to the team.\nEspecially on this type of wicket batsmen can get runs to build up innings and bowlersâ€™ performance are very vital to restrict opponents, said Perera.\nI think foreign players service and mixed with our local players always very vital from this LPL and most important is to maintain good momentum during the matches. Getting first win at Dambulla Stadium was very good . The foreign players Reza Hendrikas, Mark Chapman are in good form while the paceman like Mustafizur Rahman always strength to Dambulla and young Chamindu Wickrmasinghe also an asset to them.\nMeanwhile Galle Marvels led by Niroshan Dikwella having 3 wins out of 4 matches having services of two foreign players Tim Seifert and Alex Hales who always power their batting department. All rounder Isuru Udana who was last Kandy Falcons game man of the match used his experience especially during the power play. Udana already retired from International cricket plays active role in franchise cricket this time as a Galle Marvels key player. I think year by year LPL get good developments and we hope few players can be found from this franchise tournaments said Udana mixing with foreign players is extra benefit for young players to share their experience. Our coach Graham Ford had good knowledge about these wickets as well as our players as he was the former Sri Lanka coach. We wanted to maintain winning momentum to go forward said Isuru Udana.\nMeanwhile Kandy Falcons will meet table leaders Jaffna Kings in their game at 2.30 pm. Jaffna led by Charith Asalanka having best net run rate (0.516) with 6 points on top. Batting is key strength of Jaffna having services of Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis,Avishka Fernando and skipper Asalanka while Azmatullah Omarzai the all rounder from Afghanistan is in good form. Kandy Falcons led by Wanindu Hasaranga couldnâ€™t make good performance while they are looking to come back in this game. Experienced Angelo Mathews, Dasun Shanaka and skipper Wanindu Hasaranga have big responsibility to put up a good challenge while Dinesh Chandimal also has to come from as a opener.\nGalle Marvels also having 6 points with 0.369 run rate on second after four matches while Colombo Strikers having 4 points in third place and both Dambulla Sixes and Kandy Falcons having only 2 points each with a solitary win are fourth and fifth while Dambulla who got 8 wickets win over Colombo Strikers having better run rate ahead of Kandy Falcons.\nThe post Dambulla Sixes out to put up a good fight against Galle Marvels appeared first on DailyNews.','2024-07-08','Sport','https://www.dailynews.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/16-Dambulla-02.jpg','https://www.dailynews.lk/2024/07/09/sports/584225/dambulla-sixes-out-to-put-up-a-good-fight-against-galle-marvels/'),(57,'US$ 8 Bn relief achieved through debt restructuring â€“ President','\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said the country has saved US$ 8 billion in total over the past two years due to debt restructuring.

We are currently in negotiations with private creditors. As a result, US$ 3 billion has been withdrawn. In total, US$ 8 billion has been allocated for our use, the President said.

He emphasized that the nation is now recovering from economic turmoil due to effective economic management. He highlighted plans for inclusive development in Kurunegala district as part of advancing the countryâ€™s new economy.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe further elaborated; In the Kurunegala district, our farmers, who are vital to our rice supply, have lacked rightful ownership of their lands for too long. Today, hundreds of thousands of people across our country face the challenge of living without legal rights to their homes. We launched the â€œUrumayaâ€ programme to ensure they receive the rights they deserve.\nWhen I took office, it was a time of great uncertainty.Leaders were scarce, but I stepped up to lead. We formed a government by uniting different parties, and together, weâ€™ve made significant strides in addressing the peopleâ€™s concerns.\nWhen our countryâ€™s economy collapsed, many lost hope. Today, I must express my gratitude to the residents of this area. Despite facing personal challenges akin to a house on fire, they prioritized community welfare and worked tirelessly to provide relief. Now, our country has emerged from bankruptcy. We have a four-year plan to repay our loans, offering reduced burdens and interest cuts that will yield USD 5 billion in savings.\nWe are currently in negotiations with private contractors. As a result, approximately USD 3 billion has been withdrawn. In total, USD 8 billion has been allocated for our use. Additionally, we have been granted USD 2 billion under relaxed terms. This does not account for funds expected from China or assistance from India. As a result, we have saved USD 8 billion over the past two years.\nBefore assuming office, during President Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s tenure, India provided USD 3.5 billion on favourable loan terms. Bangladesh also contributed USD 200 million. Despite economic challenges, we managed to repay USD 200 million.\nIâ€™ve had to make tough decisions to rebuild our economy. Raising VAT wasnâ€™t easy, but it was necessary to stabilize our economy. Some leaders urged people to protest and even burn houses, urging them not to support the government. Farmers were told to come to Colombo, but without fuel and fertilizers, they couldnâ€™t come. We provided essential fuel and fertilizers to support them. Eventually, they were asked to come to Colombo without planting crops.\nThanks to the harvest in 2022-2023, the countryâ€™s production increased, and tourism thrived. As a result, weâ€™ve achieved an USD 8 billion relief and paved the way to debt relief. When the economy collapses, it affects ordinary people the most. When it recovers, its benefits reach another segment. We launched the â€œUrumayaâ€ freehold land deeds program to benefit ordinary people. Today, these individuals have full ownership rights to the land theyâ€™ve lived on for generations.

Addressing a group of community police members in Wellawaya, on Saturday, he expressed serious concern about the practice of human rights activists and lawyers rising in defence of drug lords taken into custody. Opinion may be divided on this score, but the Presidentâ€™s concern undoubtedly resonates with the public, given the increasing severity of the drug menace, which has engulfed even schools; the victims of the drug Mafia are without anyone to fight for their human rights!\nPresident Wickremesinghe also highlighted the inadequacies of the existing anti-drug laws, and stressed the need for new ones to fight the drug Mafia effectively. He pointed out that countries like Singapore had adopted extreme measures such as the death penalty to tackle the drug problem. One cannot but agree that there is a pressing need for strong laws in this country to protect the public against drug dealers. However, even such laws, unless enforced strictly, will serve little purpose.\nThe police embarked on a much-hyped campaign to neutralise the crime syndicates involved in drug trafficking, etc., amidst claims in some quarters that it caused human rights violations. But we believe that the anti-drug operations must go on, as they have yielded huge amounts of narcotics and helped weaken the distribution network to a considerable extent. Care must be taken to leave no room for excesses.\nHowever, the drug problem is best tackled at source. The ongoing efforts to thwart drug smuggling via sea routes have to be redoubled; a watchful eye must be kept on the countryâ€™s ports, where huge consignments of drugs have been detected. A large number of fishing craft used for drug trafficking have been taken into custody with their crew members. Increasing naval patrol to hold drug smugglers at bay, we believe, will be half the battle in breaking the back of the narcotic problem. The Navy and the Coastguard must be provided with more vessels, personnel and technology to intensify their effective anti-drug operations.\nDrug barons use a fraction of their ill-gotten wealth to retain the best lawyers in the country, bribe corrupt politicians and rogues in uniform and thereby put paid to efforts to make them pay for their crimes. The integrity of the drug testing process is also in doubt, and allegations abound that narcotic samples are tampered with.\nA notorious drug dealer, known as Kanjipani Imran, fled the country after being enlarged on bail. Many criminals like him are running their drug cartels here from overseas, and the need for new laws to prevent them being bailed out cannot be overstated. Imran is believed to have used various fronts to launder his drug money here and abroad. These dangerous characters, operating from faraway countries, are capable of having anyone physically eliminated here, as evident from the numerous killings committed at their behest. They have emerged so powerful that, a few months ago, they planned a commando-type operation with inside help to remove two drug kingpins from the CID headquarters, where they were being detained at the time. Thankfully, their plan went awry. This shows that while the issue of inadequacies and paucity of anti-drug laws are addressed urgently, much more remains to be done to eliminate the narcotic trade, which serves as a wellspring for numerous crimes and poses a threat to national security as well.\nMeanwhile, drug dealers are known to use their slush funds to bankroll election campaigns of some influential politicians. The rise of the narcotic Mafia is attributable to the nexus between drug kingpins and politicians. Hence the need to ensure transparency and accountability in respect of campaign funding while new anti-drug laws with more teeth are made and action is taken to weed out the rogues in uniform in the pay of the drug barons.','2024-07-07','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/drugs-criminals-and-human-rights/'),(88,'In bad times, ordinary people suffer; in good times, benefits reach another segment: President','By Sanath Nanayakkare\nSri Lanka has emerged from bankruptcy as it has been able to agree upon a debt repayment plan with international bondholders, which would have a cumulative financial outcome of USD 8 billion as savings for the country, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said last week.\nHe made these remarks at a ceremony where freehold land rights (title deeds) were distributed among a group of people in Kurunegala District through â€˜Urumayaâ€™ program.\nDuring his speech he noted that when the economy collapses, the ordinary people suffer and when the country is on a growth path, the benefits of that go to another segment.\nSpeaking further the President said:\nâ€œThe Interest cuts reached through the negotiations would yield USD 5 billion as savings while approximately another USD 3 billion has been withdrawn. Thus in total, USD 8 billion has been allocated for our use. Additionally, we have been granted USD 2 billion under relaxed terms. This does not account for funds expected from China or assistance from India. As a result, we have saved USD 8 billion over the past two years,â€ the President said.\nâ€œDuring President Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s tenure, India provided USD 3.5 billion on favourable loan terms. Bangladesh also contributed USD 200 million. Despite economic challenges, we managed to repay USD 200 million. These achievements were made possible as a result of the tough economic decisions I had to make amid a lot of discontent. Raising VAT wasnâ€™t easy, but it was necessary to stabilize the economy.\nThanks to the harvest in 2022-2023, the countryâ€™s production increased, and tourism thrived. With these achievements and the fiscal discipline in line with the IMF programme, we have been able to achieve debt relief accounting for USD 8 billion. . When the economy collapses, it affects ordinary people the most. When it recovers, its benefits reach another segment. We launched the â€œUrumayaâ€ freehold land deeds program to benefit the ordinary people. Today, these individuals have full ownership rights to the land theyâ€™ve lived on for generations.

No doubt the president was well aware of a suspicion in the public mind that he was behind the court action which sought a SC order that no election be held until the correct constitutional position regrading such an election was determined by the court.\nHence the alacrity with which the Presidential Media Division (PMD) sought to rubbish the story. The first message said neither the president nor his lawyers had been consulted by the litigant. The second stressed that Wickremesinghe was firmly of the view that the presidential term was for five years. It is on that basis that the Elections Commission is preparing to hold the poll later this year.\nIt was reported on Friday that the chief justice had appointed a fuller five-judge bench chaired by himself to hear the case which will be taken up on Monday. Doubtlessly there will be public interest on the arguments urged in favour of not holding an election until the constitutional position is properly determined. These, of course, were set out in the petition itself. Peopleâ€™s Action for Free and Fair Election (PAFREL) has already said it will be an intervenient petitioner. Also the Attorney General has been cited as the seventh respondent in the matter and it is unlikely that his stance will be any different from the presidentâ€™s.\nThe chances are that an early determination will be made to clear whatever uncertainty there may be. Both Opposition/SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and NPP/JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, declared candidates for the forthcoming election, as well as other political activists have alleged that Wickremesinghe is behind the FR action. The president has not yet formally declared his own candidacy although his intimates are on public record that he will run.\nAlso posters are up and advertising time bought to proclaim â€œRanil is the man for now.â€ The wide perception is that heâ€™s a runner, but that is not a certainty. Relevantly, business tycoon Dhammika Perera who has expressed an interest in running as the SLPP candidate also appears to be keeping the ball in play by projecting his DP Education endeavour giving free distance education in Information Technology (IT) to young people. It has been claimed that the project has attracted over a million participants. Though the president and Perera not so long ago appeared to be adversaries, Wickremesinghe was recently chief guestat a DP Education function at Nelun Pokuna.\nAlthough the SLPP, the Rajapaksa party which elected Wickremesinghe president, have been waffling for the past several weeks, neither saying whether they are, nor they are not backing Wickremesingheâ€™s candidature, there was a further development last week. That was when when SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam went public with the assertion that Ranil â€œwill be considered for SLPP nominationâ€ if he quits the UNP and joins their party. The SLPP, of course, cannot be happy that many of their members are appearing on Wickremesinghe platforms. Our stablemate, The Island, last Thursday ran a lead story on its front page saying the â€œSLPP â€“ UNP alliance on the verge of collapse.â€ This alliance, as everybody knows, is what is ruling the country right now.\nThat report quoted UNP Chairman, Wajiira Abeywardene, MP, responding to a question on his partyâ€™s stance on Kariyawasamâ€™s statement saying that they would await a comment from from former president Mahinda Rajapaksa on this matter. He, after all, is leader of the SLPP. But it is generally perceived that Kariyawasam is the mouthpiece for Basil Rajapaksa, the founder/strategist of that party and onetime national organizer. Indications at present is that Wickremesinghe, unless he pulls out before nomination day, will run as an independent candidate with backing from various sections of the polity rather than under the UNP and its elephant symbol. Heâ€™s been recently courting such support with a degree of success. Several SLPPers, both cabinet ministers and backbenchers, have gone public that they are backing Wickremesinghe. They credit him for pulling the country out of the post Aragalaya doldrums an achieving a degree of normalcy and stress that his steady hand is required on the tiller for a further term.\nThe law provides for defectors elected on one party ticket joining another being expelled from their original party endangering their parliamentary seats. But parties have not resorted to this possibility in recent times. There is a due process, justiciable by the courts, that must precede expulsion.

The members of the Election Commission (EC) including its Chairman and the Attorney General have been named as respondents. This petition has not come as a surprise. We are reminded of a vain attempt President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga made in 2005 to remain in office until 2006.\nWe thought the Constitution was very clear on the duration of the presidential term. Otherwise, the EC would not have undertaken to hold the presidential election this year itself. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected, in 2019, for a period of five years, and following his resignation in 2022, Parliament elected Ranil Wickremesinghe as his successor to serve the remainder of his term. We, however, do not intend to dwell on the legal aspects of a matter that is before the SC. They are best left to the learned judges. Instead, we discuss the political, social and economic issues that arise from poll postponements.\nThe Opposition is letting out howls of protest against surreptitious moves being made to postpone the upcoming presidential election. It has vowed to do everything in its power to defeat them on both political and legal fronts. The SJB, the JVP/NPP, and the SLPP dissidents have said they will come forward as intervenient petitioners in respect of the FR petition at issue. One cannot but appreciate their concerns about democracy and action to counter threats to the peopleâ€™s franchise. They can rest assured that every right-thinking person, who cherishes democracy, will be on their side. (In this country, politicians fight for the peopleâ€™s democratic rights only when they happen to be in the Opposition!)\nAttempts to have the next presidential poll put off could prove counterproductive, for they are bound to go pear-shaped, and will be seen as proof that those who are behind them are afraid of facing elections.\nThe Presidential Media Division has issued a statement that President Wickremesinghe is of the view that the EC is right in having decided to hold the next presidential election this year. It has also said the person who filed the aforesaid petition had not consulted either President Wickremesinghe or his lawyers. But it is the UNP which has called for a poll postponement. Its General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara himself has reiterated that the presidential and parliamentary polls have to be put off.\nThe SLPP has claimed that it is against postponing elections. It seems to think that Sri Lankans are suffering from amnesia. It has postponed the Local Government polls twice. There is no bigger threat to democracy than a regime that undermines the peopleâ€™s franchise. Elections not only help the people elect their representatives to run political institutions or govern the country but also enable them to canalise their resentment towards those at the levers of power in a democratic manner.\nPressure that builds up in a polity, where the people undergo unbearable economic hardships and are denied their democratic rights including franchise, or elections do not reflect the popular will due to malpractices, etc., tends to find expression in political upheavals. There have been several instances where poll postponements made Sriâ€ˆLankan democracy scream. If the SLFP-led United Front government had not extended the life of Parliament by two years from 1975 to 1977, the UNP would not have been able to obtain a steamroller majority, which it abused in every conceivable manner to suppress democracy.\nThe scrapping of a general election due in 1982 with the help of a heavily-rigged referendum, under J. R. Jayewardeneâ€™s presidency, paved the way for the second JVP uprising and a bloodbath. Thousands of young lives were lost and state assets worth billions of rupees destroyed. The social and economic costs of the JVPâ€™s reign of terror and the UNPâ€™s equally savage counterterror operations were incalculable. The Gotabaya Rajapaksa government also blundered by putting off the LG polls. If they had been held on schedule, they would have allowed the public to give vent to their pent-up anger democratically, forcing that blundering regime to heed public opinion and make a course correction without provoking the people into taking to the streets. The postponement of the LG polls last year on President Ranil Wickremesingheâ€™s watch has also created a massive pressure build-up, which has the potential to erupt into an uprising. Another poll postponement will make the situation even more volatile.\nLet those who are making a last-ditch attempt to delay the presidential election be warned that they are playing with fire. They had better recall that the Rajapaksas, who preened themselves on having defeated terrorism, had to head for the hills in 2022 as they, in their wisdom, chose to slight public opinion and ride roughshod over the people. Unless those who boast of waging a successful economic war abandon their attempts to subvert democracy and stop testing the peopleâ€™s patience, which is manifestly wearing thin, it will soon be their turn to outrun the irate public.','2024-07-04','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/keep-genie-in-bottle/'),(92,'Issues, non-issues and non sequiturs','Wednesday 3rd July, 2024\n\nThe SJB parliamentary group yesterday unanimously resolved that it would not join a national government under President Ranil Wickremesingheâ€™s leadership. What prompted it to make such a resolution suddenly is not clear. Perhaps, it has only reiterated its response to an invitation President Wickremesinghe extended about two years ago.\nOne cannot but agree that there is absolutely no need for a national government, for such an arrangement does not benefit the public in a half-baked democracy like Sri Lanka, where politicians are driven by self-interest; they join forces to further their own interests and not for the sake of the country. The so-called national unity government formed by the UNP and the SLFP-led UPFA in 2015 is a case in point. That administration, which was a coming together of a bunch of strange bedfellows, was characterised by mega scams, other forms of corruption, the aggravation of the countryâ€™s indebtedness, inefficiency and the neglect of national security. It exemplified the popular saying that two dogs at the same bone seldom agree. Competing interests and personality clashes led to tensions among its leaders, and President Sirisena sought to dislodge it eventually, albeit in vain.\nWhat Sri Lanka needs is a national-minded government as well as a national-minded Opposition. The ruling coalition is all out to retain power, and the Opposition parties are doing their darndest to capture power, and the national interest does not figure in their agendas. The country is grappling with its worst-ever economic crisis, which has adversely impacted every facet of life, but the government and the Opposition are pulling in different directions oblivious to the need for a concerted effort. Sriâ€ˆLankan political leaders did not join forces even at the height of the Vanni war or in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe made a special statement in Parliament yesterday on the debt restructuring agreements. Much more information about those pacts remains to be disclosed. It is hoped that all agreements will be made available to the public after the restructuring of ISBs (International Sovereign Bonds). The Opposition claimed that Sri Lankaâ€™s creditors had not been made to take haircuts.\nThe so-called peopleâ€™s representatives in Sri Lanka are not prepared to forgo their duty-free vehicle permits and other such perks, much less share in the suffering of the public in any manner, but the Opposition politicians want the countryâ€™s creditors to take haircuts. They are of the same mindset as inveterate delinquent cardholders who inveigh against their banks after living beyond their means and finding themselves in dire financial straits. Loans have to be paid back. Let that be the bottom line.\nParliament should debate all vital agreements related to debt restructuring, but at the same time it ought to discuss ways and means of shoring up the countryâ€™s foreign exchange reserves, enhancing national productivity, boosting exports, combating corruption, curtailing waste and rationalising state expenditure. The government deserves the flak it is receiving, but the Opposition does not provide alternative solutions to the countryâ€™s burning issues; it only bellows rhetoric, mouths populist slogans, and advocates clientelism and welfarism. Instead of taking action to eliminate corruption in the Customs, Inland Revenue and the Exercise Department and cast the tax net wide, the government is bent on squeezing the public dry. The Opposition is promising tax cuts and freebies to the public in a bid to garner votes at the upcoming election. The SJB has undertaken to allocate more funds for education, healthcare, social welfare, etc., but it will not reveal how it is going to increase state revenue. The JVP/NPP has promised to grab power from the â€˜corrupt political elitesâ€™ and hand it over to the youth! It tried to do so on two occasionsâ€”in 1971 and in the late 1980sâ€”and left thousands of youth dead. Elites circulate, according to thinkers like Pareto, and one sees no difference between the traditional political elites and the JVP/NPP leaders.\nParliamentary debates on vital national problems such as debt restructuring must not be polluted with platform rhetoric and partisan politics. It is hoped that Parliament will have a proper debate on the debt issue, and adopt a consensual approach to economic recovery instead of giving a fillip to anti-politics, which is menacingly on the rise.\n\n','2024-07-03','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/issues-non-issues-and-non-sequiturs/'),(93,'Business as usual','President Ranil Wickremesingheâ€™s address to the nation last Wednesday was a clear indication that Sri Lankaâ€™s political establishment is back to business as usual in these pre-election weeks. A deafening roar of firecrackers lighted by UNP supporters and RW aficionados plus the kiributh feasts served in many places by political aspirants looking ahead towards next yearâ€™s general election followed the presidentâ€™s declaration that the economic repair job he had undertaken following the 2022 aragalaya is well on track.\nThis optimism was certainly not reflected in the Colombo stock market which was fairly sharply down on Thursday with the declining trend continuing on Friday too as this is being written. Apologists said the market had already factored forward movement on the resolution of the external debt problem these past many weeks to explain away the downturn despite the presidentâ€™s favourable spin.\nFirecrackers and kiributh are very much a part of Sri Lankaâ€™s election scene and political culture. Some had expected the president, during last weekâ€™s address, to formally declare his candidacy for the election to be announced in July and probably held some time in October. Although Wickremesinghe stopped short of saying he would be running, he took advantage of the platform to tilt at Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, both declared candidates and likely front runners at the forthcoming contest.\nPredictably there was no finger pointing at the Rajapaksas who had enthroned him and keeps him in office. He obviously desists from upsetting any apple cart as the SLPP continues with the cat and mouse game of saying theyâ€™ll run at the election but refrains from naming a candidate. The Rajapaksas are also unhappy about many of their members throwing their weight behind the incumbent president.\nWickremesinghe himself would not have expected a broad national audience to closely follow a very long speech peppered with technical jargon. Whether orchestrated or not, the state media highlighted the positives, as it always does or must do, while publishing the full text of the speech most readers are unlikely to wade through. But the president correctly assesses that he has been credited in the public mind for hauling the nation out of the deep pit into which his predecessors had pushed it.\nWho after all can forget the miles long petrol and diesel queues, the gas queues and power cuts that are no longer with us. While the rupee has appreciated against the dollar, consumers have little respite in terms of reduction of prices of imported goods. Periodic announcements of inflation numbers are not reflected in the market place.\nThe president has not tired of the vel paalama (bridge built with creepers) analogy he has borrowed from Bertolt Brechtâ€™s The Caucasian Chalk Circle. He used it again last Wednesday to claim that he had safely carried endangered Mother Lanka across a precipitous abyss. From all that he said, it is clear Sri Lanka is nowhere out of the woods though he naturally presented the existing picture in the most favourable light possible.\nWeâ€™ve been granted considerable time to repay our bilateral debt installments for a period stretching from 2028 to 2043 â€œon concessional terms.â€ But there was no specific mention of â€˜haircutsâ€™ (reduction of capital payable) or reduced interest rates.\nAlso, the Official Creditors Committee (OCC) with whom the Paris deal was struck has called for details on the arrangement with China which too was signed last week. China was not a participant but was present as an observer during the OCC process. The information now sought by OCC, it has been said, is to ensure that all creditors are accorded comparable treatment.\nThe total picture will, no doubt, become clearer when the details of the arrangements that have been finalized are presented to parliament on July 2 when a special session has been summoned. The debate must necessarily present a more balanced picture that an ex parte statement.\nThere is no denying a forward movement on the economic front but that has come at a price. While the people are taxed to boost government revenue, there are no signs whatever of any serious effort of reducing numbers in the public service bloated by political patronage over a very long period of time. A large number of demands for substantial increases in public sector wages are on the table. But these are not demands that can be granted given the current state of the public exchequer.\nMeanwhile protests, strikes, water cannons and teargas are frequent occurrences. Thankfully money printing that seriously eroded peopleâ€™s savings is now no more so there can be no resort to the printing press which was a fact of life in the not so distant past.\nDo those demanding higher wages which the government cannot afford to grant realize that they are among the fortunate salaried and pensionable public servants? Nobody can deny that living on a government salary is not easy in the climate of ever rising prices. But do teachers, for example, ever think of their own shortcomings that have driven a large proportion of the school going population to the clutches of the private tuition industry? How many of them are beneficiaries of that industry?','2024-06-29','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/business-as-usual/'),(94,'EC in cockpit; Saturn in beggarâ€™s bowl','Thursday 4th July, 2024\n\nThe Election Commission (EC) has issued a media statement, reminding political parties and politicians that although the Local Government (LG) polls have been postponed, election laws governing them are in effect. Therefore, the EC has warned that at present nobody must promote any specific candidate, political party, or independent group. It has also informed all heads of public institutions, through a circular and a gazette extraordinary, that no state property must be utilised for this purpose. The ECâ€™s actions and warning are timely; complaints abound that the politicians who have submitted nominations for the LG polls are involved in the presidential election campaigns of their political parties. The government stands accused of involving its LG polls candidates in state-funded development activities at the grassroots level so that they can gain political mileage while carrying out its presidential election campaign.\nSome political parties, such as the UNP, the SJB and the NPP, are busy promoting themselves as well as their prospective presidential candidates in view of the next presidential election, which has not yet been called officially. These political parties have submitted nominations for the deferred LG polls, and therefore it can be argued that they are violating the election laws. Arenâ€™t there sufficient grounds for legal action to be taken against them?\nInterestingly, the laws governing the LG and presidential polls will overlap soon when the EC declares the next presidential election. This unprecedented situation could raise a legal dilemma. Will the presidential election laws take precedence over those governing the LG polls, or will the LG election laws apply only to the LG candidates, excluding the political parties and independent groups they represent, in the run-up to the upcoming presidential election? The resulting confusion among the public could undermine the integrity of the election laws and the electoral process besides eroding public trust therein. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a clarification.\nAll election laws prohibit the misuse or abuse of public property for electioneering, but some questionable practices are prevalent, and, worse, they have been taken for granted. The President, the Prime Minister and ministers use government vehicles and even the SLAF aircraft for campaign related activities which are craftily made to look like official engagements. Needless to say, they do so at the expense of the public amidst a crippling economic crisis. These practices that amount to a blatant violation of election laws must be brought to an end; government politicians who misuse the state machinery, the publicly-owned aircraft and vehicles can carry out their election campaigns much more efficiently than their Opposition counterparts at lower costs, leaving the public to foot the bill. Extraordinary security arrangements for government bigwigsâ€™ travel throughout the country also cost the public an arm and a leg. If the existing laws do not provide for banning such practices, new ones must be brought in to ensure a level playing field for all candidates. Curiously, this issue has not been taken up in Parliament. Maybe the Opposition has chosen to remain silent because it is hoping to do likewise in the event of being voted into power.\nIt defies comprehension why the President, the Prime Minister, ministers and the Opposition Leader should be allowed to use their official vehicles, etc., for political work even during non-election times. They must be prevented from misusing state assets and public funds for their political work. They have a right to engage in politics but at their own expense, and the public, already crushed under multiple burdens including unconscionably high taxes, must not be made to pay through the nose to meet unnecessary expenses. The peopleâ€™s predicament, which in fact is a double whammy caused by spendthrift, inefficient politicians, is like Saturn, the evildoer, landing in a beggarâ€™s bowl, as a local saying goes.','2024-07-04','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/ec-in-cockpit-saturn-in-beggars-bowl/'),(95,'Darley Road puppet show','Saturday 6th July, 2024\nTime was when the SLFP and the UNP dominated Sri Lankan politics, and captured power almost alternately so much so that we had a two-party system to all intents and purposes.

Worse, their offshoots have not only overtaken them but also rendered them almost irrelevant in national politics.\nThe UNP is lucky that the elevation of its leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, to the presidency, albeit fortuitously, has enabled it to recover some lost ground on the political front. But the SLFP continues to sink in a political mire of its own making apparently with no prospect of recovery anytime soon.\nIn what can be considered a dramatic turn of events, MP Dayasiri Jayasekera, who obtained an interim order from the Colombo District Court against the SLFPâ€™s decision to strip him of party membership and the post of General Secretary, assumed duties in front of the SLFP Headquarters at Darley Road, Colombo 10, yesterday. The police did not allow him to enter the party office.\nNo sooner had the interim order in question been issued than Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, whom the Chandrika faction of the SLFP appointed as the party Chairman, sacked Jayasekera. Now, there are two persons staking claims to the SLFP chairmanshipâ€”Minister de Silva and Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha. There are three persons who claim to be the SLFP General Secretaryâ€”Jayasekera, Dushmantha Mitrapala and Duminda Dissanayake. The partyâ€™s rank and file are confused and frustrated; many of them have already voted with their feet. Most of the SLFP MPs, elected on the SLPP ticket, have switched their allegiance to President Wickremesinghe.\nFormer President Maithripala Sirisena, who resigned as the SLFP Chairman, is pulling the strings. Ex-President Kumaratunga is doing likewise. Their proxies are at war. The unfolding Darley Road drama is like an Ambalangoda rookada (puppet) show.\nThe police are all out to ensure that the rivals of the Chandrika faction do not gain access to the SLFP party office. It is obvious that they are doing so at the behest of the powers that be. The anti-Sirisena faction of the SLFP supports President Wickremesinghe. Sirisena and his loyalists were planning to field Minister Rajapaksha as the SLFPâ€™s presidential candidate. Their attempt has been in vain; their rivals have gained the upper hand with the help of the police, and others.\nThe SLFP is no stranger to internecine legal battles among its ambitious leaders. Even some members of the Bandaranaike family failed to be different, and as a result the SLFP remained in the political wilderness for 17 years, after its humiliating defeat at the 1977 general election.\nThe SLFP has had two of its General Secretaries decampingâ€”S. B. Dissanayake in 2001 and Sirisena in late 2014. In 2005, the then President Kumaratunga sought to queer the pitch for the SLFPâ€™s presidential candidate, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had ruffled her feathers. She failed in her endeavour. Ten years later, President Sirisena ruined the SLFP-led UPFAâ€™s chances of winning a general election, as he had an axe to grind with Mahinda, who was the partyâ€™s prime ministerial candidate at the time. The SLFP has not recovered from the crippling split it suffered due to clashes between the then Sirisena-Kumaratunga faction, which sided with the UNP, and the Rajapaksa loyalists.\nThe SLFP is in the current predicament because its leaders never hesitate to subjugate its interests to their personal agendas. Whichever faction emerges victorious in the intraparty war at Darley Road, the SLFP will lose, for at this rate it is likely to end up being a mere nameboard, having lost significance, influence and following.','2024-07-05','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/darley-road-puppet-show/'),(96,'Of that debt debate','Tuesday 2nd July, 2024\n\nParliament is to have a debate on the recently-concluded external debt restructuring agreement between Sri Lanka and some of its foreign creditors. It is hoped that the focus of the House will remain undivided on the countryâ€™s debt crisis and the ways and means of overcoming it, and nothing else. Parliamentary debates usually descend into slanging matches.\nOpinion is divided on the aforesaid agreement which the government has made out to be a huge success. The Opposition has dismissed it as a sellout, claiming that the government has agreed to conditions totally unfavourable to the country. The truth, we believe, is somewhere between these two extreme positions.\nThe debt structuring agreement has provided Sri Lanka with some respite, but by no stretch of the imagination can it be considered an achievement worthy of celebration. Sriâ€ˆLankaâ€™s International Sovereign Bonds have not yet been restructured; the government is hopeful that an agreement with the bondholders can be reached. There is a long way to go before we achieve debt sustainability, the be-all and end-all of breaking the back of the current crisis, and putting the economy back on an even keel. This is a gargantuan task that requires a substantial increase in the countryâ€™s export revenue and a drastic reduction in the outflow of foreign exchange, among other things.\nThe Oppositionâ€™s position on external debt restructuring smacks of a mindset that the foreign creditors must be penalised for Sri Lankaâ€™s blunders which have brought about the current crisis. True, Sri Lanka would have gained hugely if its creditors had been made to agree to big haircuts and other such extreme measures, but the question is whether it would have been able to borrow again from external sources in such an eventuality.\nHow can the foreign creditors be expected to be so considerate as to take huge haircuts for the sake of Sri Lanka while some local trade unions are demanding their pound of flesh or even more, and the MPs are all out to secure duty-free vehicle permits, which will be a drain on the countryâ€™s foreign currency reserves? Worse, Sri Lankan exporters stand accused of parking their export proceeds overseas.\nMeanwhile, the crisis we are facing is multi-factorial although our focus is only on the economic aspects thereof. Therefore, our efforts to solve it once and for all should not be limited to the economic front. The need for social and political reforms to prepare the country for doing what needs to be done to overcome the present crisis cannot be overemphasised. We are without a work ethic as such and our attitude to work, as a nation, is appalling, to say the least; it is only natural that our national productivity remains woefully low, and we continue to be dependent on foreign aid.\nIdeally, the government and the Opposition should have got together to help resolve the countryâ€™s worst-ever economic crisis, and formulated a recovery strategy, instead of playing politics with the issue. In fact, all members of the current Parliament are duty bound to make a collective effort to hoist the country out of its debt crisis. The SLPP government on Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s watch precipitated the economic crisis, but successive governments have contributed to the countryâ€™s unsustainable debt, albeit to varying degrees. Those in the current Opposition were in the Yahapalana  government or were supportive of that regime, which borrowed more than USD 10 billion between 2015 and 2019, according to SLPP Leader and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The SJB MPs were in the UNP at the time. The TNA, the JVP, etc., fully backed the Yahapalana administration, and even prevented its collapse in 2018 by helping it muster a parliamentary majority. Besides, the TNA backed the LTTE, which inflicted incalculable damage on the economy, and the JVP itself destroyed state assets worth billions of rupees in the late 1980s.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe has expressed his willingness to consider alternative proposals outlining a viable strategy to overcome the debt crisis. He has invited the Opposition to submit such proposals, if any, and undertaken to facilitate a meeting between the proponents thereof and the IMF representatives. Will the Opposition take up the challenge and present an alternative plan when the debt deals are taken up for debate?','2024-07-02','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/of-that-debt-debate/'),(97,'A coup that was not','Saturday 29th June, 2024\nBolivia, on Wednesday, was shaken by what looked like the onset of a military coup. A large number of soldiers rushed in armoured vehicles and stormed the Murillo Square in the capital, La Paz, where key government institutions are located. Acting under the command of the head of the armed forces General Juan JosÃ© ZÃºÃ±iga, they attempted to force themselves into the Presidentâ€™s House by smashing down a wall. In a dramatic turn of events, the beleaguered President Louis Arce put up resistance intrepidly much to the surprise of everyone. He went on to appoint a new military commander, and the police arrested ZÃºÃ±iga. Order was restored in about three hours.\nBolivia is no stranger to military coups and has its share of generals with political ambitions. In 2019, the military stepped in to oust President Evo Morales following a disputed election outcome, paving the way for the appointment of an interim President. Arce became the President in 2020. Morales, who came to power in 2006, riding on a wave of popularity, endeared himself to the Bolivian public by undertaking to share in their suffering. He and his ministers took pay cuts and their approval rating shot up. But after being ensconced in power, Morales failed to live up to peopleâ€™s expectations and had to leave amidst public protests.\nInterestingly, General ZÃºÃ±iga told reporters, on Wednesday, that he had staged the â€˜coupâ€™ at the behest of President Arce himself! The incident has since come to be known as a â€˜self-coupâ€™ in some quarters. Whether the Generalâ€™s claim is true or false, one may not know, but the manner in which the â€˜coupâ€™ unfolded and ended, and the sangfroid of President Arce and his Cabinet have given rise to doubts and suspicions in the minds of Bolivians as well as others.\nSome political commentators are of the view that ZÃºÃ±iga has told the truth. They point out that President Arce is troubled by the prospect of having to face a popular uprising soon. His popularity is on the wane due to his governmentâ€™s inability to manage the floundering economy, which is reeling from a biting foreign exchange crisis caused by a drastic drop in gas exports. Wednesdayâ€™s â€˜coupâ€™ unified all those across the political spectrum, in Bolivia, including former President Morales, a bitter critic of the incumbent government; it has enabled Arce to rally public support, and shore up his image. ZÃºÃ±iga has also alleged Morales is planning to run for President despite a constitutionally-stipulated term limit and the latter has to be stopped.\nBolivia and other democratic nations heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday when the â€˜coupâ€™ came to an end, but socio-economic factors that have the potential to trigger an uprising and creating conditions for a real military intervention in the form of another coup remain in the Andean state, where public resentment is said to be palpable. Trouble is therefore far from over. Wednesdayâ€™s incident may be considered a foretaste of what is to come.\nAmbitious generals usually capitalise on public resentment and economic crises to project themselves as saviours and grab state power, as has been the experience of many countries in Latin America. They also do so at the instigation of foreign powers, the bloody overthrow of Salvador Allendeâ€™s democratically-elected, progressive government in Chile, one of Boliviaâ€™s neighbours, in 1973, being a case in point. The Bolivian Opposition and human rights groups have expressed fear that President Arce will use Wednesdayâ€™s incident to launch a campaign to suppress the Opposition. Arrests continue to be made, according to international media reports.\nAllâ€™s well that ends well, but it is hoped that the apparent coup in Bolivia will serve as a warning to all other nations which are facing similar political, social and economic problems, and that their leaders will refrain from provoking the public into staging uprisings and providing ambitious generals with opportunities to make forays into politics. The problem with political power is it is highly addictive like narcotics, and one who saviours it does not want to let go of it.','2024-06-28','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/a-coup-that-was-not/'),(98,'Whodunnit?','President Ranil Wickremesinghe was quick to dissociate himself from the Fundamental Rights action on the forthcoming election filed in the Supreme Court last week by an unknown private citizen whose name, Chamindra Dayan Lenawa, was published in all the newspapers and electronic media bulletins that ran the story. No doubt the president was well aware of a suspicion in the public mind that he was behind the court action which sought a SC order that no election be held until the correct constitutional position regrading such an election was determined by the court.\nHence the alacrity with which the Presidential Media Division (PMD) sought to rubbish the story. The first message said neither the president nor his lawyers had been consulted by the litigant. The second stressed that Wickremesinghe was firmly of the view that the presidential term was for five years. It is on that basis that the Elections Commission is preparing to hold the poll later this year.\nIt was reported on Friday that the chief justice had appointed a fuller five-judge bench chaired by himself to hear the case which will be taken up on Monday. Doubtlessly there will be public interest on the arguments urged in favour of not holding an election until the constitutional position is properly determined. These, of course, were set out in the petition itself. Peopleâ€™s Action for Free and Fair Election (PAFREL) has already said it will be an intervenient petitioner. Also the Attorney General has been cited as the seventh respondent in the matter and it is unlikely that his stance will be any different from the presidentâ€™s.\nThe chances are that an early determination will be made to clear whatever uncertainty there may be. Both Opposition/SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and NPP/JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, declared candidates for the forthcoming election, as well as other political activists have alleged that Wickremesinghe is behind the FR action. The president has not yet formally declared his own candidacy although his intimates are on public record that he will run.\nAlso posters are up and advertising time bought to proclaim â€œRanil is the man for now.â€ The wide perception is that heâ€™s a runner, but that is not a certainty. Relevantly, business tycoon Dhammika Perera who has expressed an interest in running as the SLPP candidate also appears to be keeping the ball in play by projecting his DP Education endeavour giving free distance education in Information Technology (IT) to young people. It has been claimed that the project has attracted over a million participants. Though the president and Perera not so long ago appeared to be adversaries, Wickremesinghe was recently chief guestat a DP Education function at Nelun Pokuna.\nAlthough the SLPP, the Rajapaksa party which elected Wickremesinghe president, have been waffling for the past several weeks, neither saying whether they are, nor they are not backing Wickremesingheâ€™s candidature, there was a further development last week. That was when when SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam went public with the assertion that Ranil â€œwill be considered for SLPP nominationâ€ if he quits the UNP and joins their party. The SLPP, of course, cannot be happy that many of their members are appearing on Wickremesinghe platforms. Our stablemate, The Island, last Thursday ran a lead story on its front page saying the â€œSLPP â€“ UNP alliance on the verge of collapse.â€ This alliance, as everybody knows, is what is ruling the country right now.\nThat report quoted UNP Chairman, Wajiira Abeywardene, MP, responding to a question on his partyâ€™s stance on Kariyawasamâ€™s statement saying that they would await a comment from from former president Mahinda Rajapaksa on this matter. He, after all, is leader of the SLPP. But it is generally perceived that Kariyawasam is the mouthpiece for Basil Rajapaksa, the founder/strategist of that party and onetime national organizer. Indications at present is that Wickremesinghe, unless he pulls out before nomination day, will run as an independent candidate with backing from various sections of the polity rather than under the UNP and its elephant symbol. Heâ€™s been recently courting such support with a degree of success. Several SLPPers, both cabinet ministers and backbenchers, have gone public that they are backing Wickremesinghe. They credit him for pulling the country out of the post Aragalaya doldrums an achieving a degree of normalcy and stress that his steady hand is required on the tiller for a further term.\nThe law provides for defectors elected on one party ticket joining another being expelled from their original party endangering their parliamentary seats. But parties have not resorted to this possibility in recent times. There is a due process, justiciable by the courts, that must precede expulsion. However, that sleeping dog has been allowed to lie by most political parties in recent times despite numerous defections.','2024-07-06','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/whodunnit/'),(99,'Drugs, criminals and human rights','Monday 8th July, 2024\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe has put his finger on some factors that have rendered the task of ridding the country of the scourge of narcotics frustratingly difficult. Addressing a group of community police members in Wellawaya, on Saturday, he expressed serious concern about the practice of human rights activists and lawyers rising in defence of drug lords taken into custody. Opinion may be divided on this score, but the Presidentâ€™s concern undoubtedly resonates with the public, given the increasing severity of the drug menace, which has engulfed even schools; the victims of the drug Mafia are without anyone to fight for their human rights!\nPresident Wickremesinghe also highlighted the inadequacies of the existing anti-drug laws, and stressed the need for new ones to fight the drug Mafia effectively. He pointed out that countries like Singapore had adopted extreme measures such as the death penalty to tackle the drug problem. One cannot but agree that there is a pressing need for strong laws in this country to protect the public against drug dealers. However, even such laws, unless enforced strictly, will serve little purpose.\nThe police embarked on a much-hyped campaign to neutralise the crime syndicates involved in drug trafficking, etc., amidst claims in some quarters that it caused human rights violations. But we believe that the anti-drug operations must go on, as they have yielded huge amounts of narcotics and helped weaken the distribution network to a considerable extent. Care must be taken to leave no room for excesses.\nHowever, the drug problem is best tackled at source. The ongoing efforts to thwart drug smuggling via sea routes have to be redoubled; a watchful eye must be kept on the countryâ€™s ports, where huge consignments of drugs have been detected. A large number of fishing craft used for drug trafficking have been taken into custody with their crew members. Increasing naval patrol to hold drug smugglers at bay, we believe, will be half the battle in breaking the back of the narcotic problem. The Navy and the Coastguard must be provided with more vessels, personnel and technology to intensify their effective anti-drug operations.\nDrug barons use a fraction of their ill-gotten wealth to retain the best lawyers in the country, bribe corrupt politicians and rogues in uniform and thereby put paid to efforts to make them pay for their crimes. The integrity of the drug testing process is also in doubt, and allegations abound that narcotic samples are tampered with.\nA notorious drug dealer, known as Kanjipani Imran, fled the country after being enlarged on bail. Many criminals like him are running their drug cartels here from overseas, and the need for new laws to prevent them being bailed out cannot be overstated. Imran is believed to have used various fronts to launder his drug money here and abroad. These dangerous characters, operating from faraway countries, are capable of having anyone physically eliminated here, as evident from the numerous killings committed at their behest. They have emerged so powerful that, a few months ago, they planned a commando-type operation with inside help to remove two drug kingpins from the CID headquarters, where they were being detained at the time. Thankfully, their plan went awry. This shows that while the issue of inadequacies and paucity of anti-drug laws are addressed urgently, much more remains to be done to eliminate the narcotic trade, which serves as a wellspring for numerous crimes and poses a threat to national security as well.\nMeanwhile, drug dealers are known to use their slush funds to bankroll election campaigns of some influential politicians. The rise of the narcotic Mafia is attributable to the nexus between drug kingpins and politicians. Hence the need to ensure transparency and accountability in respect of campaign funding while new anti-drug laws with more teeth are made and action is taken to weed out the rogues in uniform in the pay of the drug barons.','2024-07-07','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/drugs-criminals-and-human-rights/'),(100,'Darley Road puppet show','Saturday 6th July, 2024\nTime was when the SLFP and the UNP dominated Sri Lankan politics, and captured power almost alternately so much so that we had a two-party system to all intents and purposes. But today they have become shadows of their former selves and are struggling for survival. Worse, their offshoots have not only overtaken them but also rendered them almost irrelevant in national politics.\nThe UNP is lucky that the elevation of its leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, to the presidency, albeit fortuitously, has enabled it to recover some lost ground on the political front. But the SLFP continues to sink in a political mire of its own making apparently with no prospect of recovery anytime soon.\nIn what can be considered a dramatic turn of events, MP Dayasiri Jayasekera, who obtained an interim order from the Colombo District Court against the SLFPâ€™s decision to strip him of party membership and the post of General Secretary, assumed duties in front of the SLFP Headquarters at Darley Road, Colombo 10, yesterday. The police did not allow him to enter the party office.\nNo sooner had the interim order in question been issued than Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, whom the Chandrika faction of the SLFP appointed as the party Chairman, sacked Jayasekera. Now, there are two persons staking claims to the SLFP chairmanshipâ€”Minister de Silva and Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha. There are three persons who claim to be the SLFP General Secretaryâ€”Jayasekera, Dushmantha Mitrapala and Duminda Dissanayake. The partyâ€™s rank and file are confused and frustrated; many of them have already voted with their feet. Most of the SLFP MPs, elected on the SLPP ticket, have switched their allegiance to President Wickremesinghe.\nFormer President Maithripala Sirisena, who resigned as the SLFP Chairman, is pulling the strings. Ex-President Kumaratunga is doing likewise. Their proxies are at war. The unfolding Darley Road drama is like an Ambalangoda rookada (puppet) show.\nThe police are all out to ensure that the rivals of the Chandrika faction do not gain access to the SLFP party office. It is obvious that they are doing so at the behest of the powers that be. The anti-Sirisena faction of the SLFP supports President Wickremesinghe. Sirisena and his loyalists were planning to field Minister Rajapaksha as the SLFPâ€™s presidential candidate. Their attempt has been in vain; their rivals have gained the upper hand with the help of the police, and others.\nThe SLFP is no stranger to internecine legal battles among its ambitious leaders. Even some members of the Bandaranaike family failed to be different, and as a result the SLFP remained in the political wilderness for 17 years, after its humiliating defeat at the 1977 general election.\nThe SLFP has had two of its General Secretaries decampingâ€”S. B. Dissanayake in 2001 and Sirisena in late 2014. In 2005, the then President Kumaratunga sought to queer the pitch for the SLFPâ€™s presidential candidate, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had ruffled her feathers. She failed in her endeavour. Ten years later, President Sirisena ruined the SLFP-led UPFAâ€™s chances of winning a general election, as he had an axe to grind with Mahinda, who was the partyâ€™s prime ministerial candidate at the time. The SLFP has not recovered from the crippling split it suffered due to clashes between the then Sirisena-Kumaratunga faction, which sided with the UNP, and the Rajapaksa loyalists.\nThe SLFP is in the current predicament because its leaders never hesitate to subjugate its interests to their personal agendas. Whichever faction emerges victorious in the intraparty war at Darley Road, the SLFP will lose, for at this rate it is likely to end up being a mere nameboard, having lost significance, influence and following.','2024-07-05','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/darley-road-puppet-show/'),(101,'Keep genie in bottle','Friday 5th July, 2024\nA person described as an entrepreneur from Moratuwa has filed a fundamental rights (FR) petition, seeking a Supreme Court (SC) determination on the duration of the presidentâ€™s term, and an interim order preventing the official announcement of the next presidential election until the apex court decision.

We are reminded of a vain attempt President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga made in 2005 to remain in office until 2006.\nWe thought the Constitution was very clear on the duration of the presidential term. Otherwise, the EC would not have undertaken to hold the presidential election this year itself. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected, in 2019, for a period of five years, and following his resignation in 2022, Parliament elected Ranil Wickremesinghe as his successor to serve the remainder of his term. We, however, do not intend to dwell on the legal aspects of a matter that is before the SC. They are best left to the learned judges. Instead, we discuss the political, social and economic issues that arise from poll postponements.\nThe Opposition is letting out howls of protest against surreptitious moves being made to postpone the upcoming presidential election. It has vowed to do everything in its power to defeat them on both political and legal fronts.

One cannot but appreciate their concerns about democracy and action to counter threats to the peopleâ€™s franchise. They can rest assured that every right-thinking person, who cherishes democracy, will be on their side. (In this country, politicians fight for the peopleâ€™s democratic rights only when they happen to be in the Opposition!)\nAttempts to have the next presidential poll put off could prove counterproductive, for they are bound to go pear-shaped, and will be seen as proof that those who are behind them are afraid of facing elections.\nThe Presidential Media Division has issued a statement that President Wickremesinghe is of the view that the EC is right in having decided to hold the next presidential election this year. It has also said the person who filed the aforesaid petition had not consulted either President Wickremesinghe or his lawyers. But it is the UNP which has called for a poll postponement. Its General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara himself has reiterated that the presidential and parliamentary polls have to be put off.\nThe SLPP has claimed that it is against postponing elections. It seems to think that Sri Lankans are suffering from amnesia. It has postponed the Local Government polls twice. There is no bigger threat to democracy than a regime that undermines the peopleâ€™s franchise. Elections not only help the people elect their representatives to run political institutions or govern the country but also enable them to canalise their resentment towards those at the levers of power in a democratic manner.\nPressure that builds up in a polity, where the people undergo unbearable economic hardships and are denied their democratic rights including franchise, or elections do not reflect the popular will due to malpractices, etc., tends to find expression in political upheavals. There have been several instances where poll postponements made Sriâ€ˆLankan democracy scream. If the SLFP-led United Front government had not extended the life of Parliament by two years from 1975 to 1977, the UNP would not have been able to obtain a steamroller majority, which it abused in every conceivable manner to suppress democracy.\nThe scrapping of a general election due in 1982 with the help of a heavily-rigged referendum, under J. R. Jayewardeneâ€™s presidency, paved the way for the second JVP uprising and a bloodbath. Thousands of young lives were lost and state assets worth billions of rupees destroyed. The social and economic costs of the JVPâ€™s reign of terror and the UNPâ€™s equally savage counterterror operations were incalculable. The Gotabaya Rajapaksa government also blundered by putting off the LG polls. If they had been held on schedule, they would have allowed the public to give vent to their pent-up anger democratically, forcing that blundering regime to heed public opinion and make a course correction without provoking the people into taking to the streets. The postponement of the LG polls last year on President Ranil Wickremesingheâ€™s watch has also created a massive pressure build-up, which has the potential to erupt into an uprising. Another poll postponement will make the situation even more volatile.\nLet those who are making a last-ditch attempt to delay the presidential election be warned that they are playing with fire. They had better recall that the Rajapaksas, who preened themselves on having defeated terrorism, had to head for the hills in 2022 as they, in their wisdom, chose to slight public opinion and ride roughshod over the people.

She is expected to appeal against her conviction. As a lawyer, Hirunika should have known better than to take the law into her own hands. What possessed her to commit the crime that has landed her in prison?\nHirunika and several others committed the aforesaid offences during the heyday of the UNP-led Yahapalana government. The UNP-led UNF was ensconced in power and President Maithripala Sirisena was going strong at the time. Hirunika, like the other young UNF MPs in the good books of the government leaders of the day may have thought she was above the law.\nThe problem with political power is that it goes to the heads of those who wield it, and have the same effect as intoxicants on them. Hence, the politicians of the party/coalition in power take leave of their senses and become oblivious to the consequences of their actions. One may recall how an otherwise amiable Ranjan Ramanayake behaved during the Yahapalana  government, telephoning and instructing even high-ranking police officers until he was humbled by the judiciary; he was imprisoned for contempt of court. The sobering reality dawned on him while he was serving time.\nHirunika has been a storm petrel of sorts. She was instrumental in exposing the defectus or vulnerability of the Rajapaksa fortress, as it were, and instilling anti-government protesters with confidence that it could be brought down like the Walls of Jericho. On 05 March 2022, she held a womenâ€™s protest near the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s Mirihana residence, and emboldened others to do likewise. She also staged a protest near the Presidentâ€™s House, Fort, on 06 July 2022, about three days before thousands of anti-government activists stormed the place, making President Rajapaksa head for the hills. She also incurred the wrath of the leaders of the incumbent dispensation by launching scathing verbal attacks on them and their close friends.\nThe killers of The Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickremetunge, popular sportsman, Wasim Thajudeen, and several others have not been brought to justice. The tardiness of police investigations into those crimes reminds us of a popular Avurudu cycling contest, where the slowest rider is adjudged the winner, and the contestants do their darndest to move as slow as possible. New foreign exchange control laws were introduced in 2017, and about 30 fraudsters who would have faced incarceration got away with the criminal offences they had committed under the previous Act, which had more teeth. Politicians who make a vulgar display of their wealth, despite their humble beginnings, have the last laugh when legal action is taken against them after regime changes.\nThe taxman looks the other way, and the national anti-graft commission is not equal to the task of prosecuting them properly. Above all, those who plunged the country into a bloodbath in the late 1980s, snuffing out thousands of lives, destroying public property worth billions of rupees, robbing banks and the public, and the perpetrators of equally heinous crimes in the name of counterterror have got off scot-free. A man who trespassed on a former Presidentâ€™s estate, and stole a few coconuts was shot the other day, but the Presidents, who are accused of indulging in corrupt practices, abusing power, jeopardising national security and ruining the economy, are looked after the by the State until they go the way of all flesh.\nThere are many politicians who are â€˜more equal than othersâ€™ before the law like the Pigs in Orwellâ€™s dystopian novella, Animal Farm.

Therefore, the EC has warned that at present nobody must promote any specific candidate, political party, or independent group. It has also informed all heads of public institutions, through a circular and a gazette extraordinary, that no state property must be utilised for this purpose. The ECâ€™s actions and warning are timely; complaints abound that the politicians who have submitted nominations for the LG polls are involved in the presidential election campaigns of their political parties. The government stands accused of involving its LG polls candidates in state-funded development activities at the grassroots level so that they can gain political mileage while carrying out its presidential election campaign.\nSome political parties, such as the UNP, the SJB and the NPP, are busy promoting themselves as well as their prospective presidential candidates in view of the next presidential election, which has not yet been called officially. These political parties have submitted nominations for the deferred LG polls, and therefore it can be argued that they are violating the election laws. Arenâ€™t there sufficient grounds for legal action to be taken against them?\nInterestingly, the laws governing the LG and presidential polls will overlap soon when the EC declares the next presidential election. This unprecedented situation could raise a legal dilemma. Will the presidential election laws take precedence over those governing the LG polls, or will the LG election laws apply only to the LG candidates, excluding the political parties and independent groups they represent, in the run-up to the upcoming presidential election? The resulting confusion among the public could undermine the integrity of the election laws and the electoral process besides eroding public trust therein. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a clarification.\nAll election laws prohibit the misuse or abuse of public property for electioneering, but some questionable practices are prevalent, and, worse, they have been taken for granted. The President, the Prime Minister and ministers use government vehicles and even the SLAF aircraft for campaign related activities which are craftily made to look like official engagements. Needless to say, they do so at the expense of the public amidst a crippling economic crisis. These practices that amount to a blatant violation of election laws must be brought to an end; government politicians who misuse the state machinery, the publicly-owned aircraft and vehicles can carry out their election campaigns much more efficiently than their Opposition counterparts at lower costs, leaving the public to foot the bill. Extraordinary security arrangements for government bigwigsâ€™ travel throughout the country also cost the public an arm and a leg. If the existing laws do not provide for banning such practices, new ones must be brought in to ensure a level playing field for all candidates. Curiously, this issue has not been taken up in Parliament. Maybe the Opposition has chosen to remain silent because it is hoping to do likewise in the event of being voted into power.\nIt defies comprehension why the President, the Prime Minister, ministers and the Opposition Leader should be allowed to use their official vehicles, etc., for political work even during non-election times. They must be prevented from misusing state assets and public funds for their political work. They have a right to engage in politics but at their own expense, and the public, already crushed under multiple burdens including unconscionably high taxes, must not be made to pay through the nose to meet unnecessary expenses.

The so-called national unity government formed by the UNP and the SLFP-led UPFA in 2015 is a case in point. That administration, which was a coming together of a bunch of strange bedfellows, was characterised by mega scams, other forms of corruption, the aggravation of the countryâ€™s indebtedness, inefficiency and the neglect of national security. It exemplified the popular saying that two dogs at the same bone seldom agree. Competing interests and personality clashes led to tensions among its leaders, and President Sirisena sought to dislodge it eventually, albeit in vain.\nWhat Sri Lanka needs is a national-minded government as well as a national-minded Opposition. The ruling coalition is all out to retain power, and the Opposition parties are doing their darndest to capture power, and the national interest does not figure in their agendas.

Sriâ€ˆLankan political leaders did not join forces even at the height of the Vanni war or in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe made a special statement in Parliament yesterday on the debt restructuring agreements. Much more information about those pacts remains to be disclosed. It is hoped that all agreements will be made available to the public after the restructuring of ISBs (International Sovereign Bonds). The Opposition claimed that Sri Lankaâ€™s creditors had not been made to take haircuts.\nThe so-called peopleâ€™s representatives in Sri Lanka are not prepared to forgo their duty-free vehicle permits and other such perks, much less share in the suffering of the public in any manner, but the Opposition politicians want the countryâ€™s creditors to take haircuts. They are of the same mindset as inveterate delinquent cardholders who inveigh against their banks after living beyond their means and finding themselves in dire financial straits. Loans have to be paid back. Let that be the bottom line.\nParliament should debate all vital agreements related to debt restructuring, but at the same time it ought to discuss ways and means of shoring up the countryâ€™s foreign exchange reserves, enhancing national productivity, boosting exports, combating corruption, curtailing waste and rationalising state expenditure. The government deserves the flak it is receiving, but the Opposition does not provide alternative solutions to the countryâ€™s burning issues; it only bellows rhetoric, mouths populist slogans, and advocates clientelism and welfarism. Instead of taking action to eliminate corruption in the Customs, Inland Revenue and the Exercise Department and cast the tax net wide, the government is bent on squeezing the public dry. The Opposition is promising tax cuts and freebies to the public in a bid to garner votes at the upcoming election. The SJB has undertaken to allocate more funds for education, healthcare, social welfare, etc., but it will not reveal how it is going to increase state revenue. The JVP/NPP has promised to grab power from the â€˜corrupt political elitesâ€™ and hand it over to the youth! It tried to do so on two occasionsâ€”in 1971 and in the late 1980sâ€”and left thousands of youth dead. Elites circulate, according to thinkers like Pareto, and one sees no difference between the traditional political elites and the JVP/NPP leaders.\nParliamentary debates on vital national problems such as debt restructuring must not be polluted with platform rhetoric and partisan politics. It is hoped that Parliament will have a proper debate on the debt issue, and adopt a consensual approach to economic recovery instead of giving a fillip to anti-politics, which is menacingly on the rise.\n\n','2024-07-03','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/issues-non-issues-and-non-sequiturs/'),(105,'Joey Clothing opens flagship store','Joey Clothing, celebrated for infusing joy and happiness into womenâ€™s wardrobes across the island recently opened its flagship store at 109 Isipathana Mawatha, Colombo 05.

It is hoped that the focus of the House will remain undivided on the countryâ€™s debt crisis and the ways and means of overcoming it, and nothing else. Parliamentary debates usually descend into slanging matches.\nOpinion is divided on the aforesaid agreement which the government has made out to be a huge success. The Opposition has dismissed it as a sellout, claiming that the government has agreed to conditions totally unfavourable to the country. The truth, we believe, is somewhere between these two extreme positions.\nThe debt structuring agreement has provided Sri Lanka with some respite, but by no stretch of the imagination can it be considered an achievement worthy of celebration. Sriâ€ˆLankaâ€™s International Sovereign Bonds have not yet been restructured; the government is hopeful that an agreement with the bondholders can be reached. There is a long way to go before we achieve debt sustainability, the be-all and end-all of breaking the back of the current crisis, and putting the economy back on an even keel. This is a gargantuan task that requires a substantial increase in the countryâ€™s export revenue and a drastic reduction in the outflow of foreign exchange, among other things.\nThe Oppositionâ€™s position on external debt restructuring smacks of a mindset that the foreign creditors must be penalised for Sri Lankaâ€™s blunders which have brought about the current crisis. True, Sri Lanka would have gained hugely if its creditors had been made to agree to big haircuts and other such extreme measures, but the question is whether it would have been able to borrow again from external sources in such an eventuality.\nHow can the foreign creditors be expected to be so considerate as to take huge haircuts for the sake of Sri Lanka while some local trade unions are demanding their pound of flesh or even more, and the MPs are all out to secure duty-free vehicle permits, which will be a drain on the countryâ€™s foreign currency reserves? Worse, Sri Lankan exporters stand accused of parking their export proceeds overseas.\nMeanwhile, the crisis we are facing is multi-factorial although our focus is only on the economic aspects thereof. Therefore, our efforts to solve it once and for all should not be limited to the economic front. The need for social and political reforms to prepare the country for doing what needs to be done to overcome the present crisis cannot be overemphasised. We are without a work ethic as such and our attitude to work, as a nation, is appalling, to say the least; it is only natural that our national productivity remains woefully low, and we continue to be dependent on foreign aid.\nIdeally, the government and the Opposition should have got together to help resolve the countryâ€™s worst-ever economic crisis, and formulated a recovery strategy, instead of playing politics with the issue. In fact, all members of the current Parliament are duty bound to make a collective effort to hoist the country out of its debt crisis. The SLPP government on Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s watch precipitated the economic crisis, but successive governments have contributed to the countryâ€™s unsustainable debt, albeit to varying degrees. Those in the current Opposition were in the Yahapalana  government or were supportive of that regime, which borrowed more than USD 10 billion between 2015 and 2019, according to SLPP Leader and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The SJB MPs were in the UNP at the time. The TNA, the JVP, etc., fully backed the Yahapalana administration, and even prevented its collapse in 2018 by helping it muster a parliamentary majority. Besides, the TNA backed the LTTE, which inflicted incalculable damage on the economy, and the JVP itself destroyed state assets worth billions of rupees in the late 1980s.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe has expressed his willingness to consider alternative proposals outlining a viable strategy to overcome the debt crisis. He has invited the Opposition to submit such proposals, if any, and undertaken to facilitate a meeting between the proponents thereof and the IMF representatives. Will the Opposition take up the challenge and present an alternative plan when the debt deals are taken up for debate?','2024-07-02','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/of-that-debt-debate/'),(109,'Mac makeup makes its mark on vibrant beauty scene','By Zanita Careem\nMakeup is a form of art. Like an artist painting, our face is our canvas. Makeup expresses everything about a personâ€™s personality, even their mood. Makeup could mean a lot of different things to people such as a way to relax, be creative, or simply just because they love doing it. Makeup can also be a hobby, some people play sports every day because they enjoy it and it is a to express on the outside how one feel on the inside. One can develop confidence without having to speak out about it.\nMakeup makes one feel put-together and boosts confidence when you need it.\nThere has always been a discussion between people who wear makeup and people who donâ€™t wear it as to the reason why people choose to put on makeup on a daily basis. Most people who donâ€™t wear makeup have the idea that people who do wear it must feel insecure about the way they look or that they donâ€™t like themselves. Even though some people start wearing makeup for this exact reason-there is nothing wrong with that! If it makes someone happy and comfortable to put on a full face of makeup every day, then they should be able to do it without being criticized for it.\nMake-up or cosmetics are generally used to augment your look. It is not something that was invented in the 21st century. In fact, we have thousands of years of history of people using makeup for several purposes. However, in the modern world, the role of makeup is just more than getting ready for ceremonies or festivals and it is something unbound by the boundaries of gender too. It is not just women who use makeup but men also do it on regular basis.\nIn modern times, makeup has become as essential as any other daily routine. Exclusive Lines, beauty store are aware of a womenâ€™s beauty,they love to enhanced women features. There is a variety of make up essentials in the market nowadays but one makeup range that gives women a unique beauty experience are the extensive range of Mac makeup catering to all skin tones.\nMac Cosmetics Debuts Flagship Store In Sri Lanka With Exclusive Lines\nThe worldâ€™s leading professional make up brand MAC was introduced to Sri Lanka recently by Exclusive Lines creating a milestone for the brand.

A deafening roar of firecrackers lighted by UNP supporters and RW aficionados plus the kiributh feasts served in many places by political aspirants looking ahead towards next yearâ€™s general election followed the presidentâ€™s declaration that the economic repair job he had undertaken following the 2022 aragalaya is well on track.\nThis optimism was certainly not reflected in the Colombo stock market which was fairly sharply down on Thursday with the declining trend continuing on Friday too as this is being written. Apologists said the market had already factored forward movement on the resolution of the external debt problem these past many weeks to explain away the downturn despite the presidentâ€™s favourable spin.\nFirecrackers and kiributh are very much a part of Sri Lankaâ€™s election scene and political culture. Some had expected the president, during last weekâ€™s address, to formally declare his candidacy for the election to be announced in July and probably held some time in October. Although Wickremesinghe stopped short of saying he would be running, he took advantage of the platform to tilt at Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, both declared candidates and likely front runners at the forthcoming contest.\nPredictably there was no finger pointing at the Rajapaksas who had enthroned him and keeps him in office. He obviously desists from upsetting any apple cart as the SLPP continues with the cat and mouse game of saying theyâ€™ll run at the election but refrains from naming a candidate. The Rajapaksas are also unhappy about many of their members throwing their weight behind the incumbent president.\nWickremesinghe himself would not have expected a broad national audience to closely follow a very long speech peppered with technical jargon. Whether orchestrated or not, the state media highlighted the positives, as it always does or must do, while publishing the full text of the speech most readers are unlikely to wade through. But the president correctly assesses that he has been credited in the public mind for hauling the nation out of the deep pit into which his predecessors had pushed it.\nWho after all can forget the miles long petrol and diesel queues, the gas queues and power cuts that are no longer with us. While the rupee has appreciated against the dollar, consumers have little respite in terms of reduction of prices of imported goods. Periodic announcements of inflation numbers are not reflected in the market place.\nThe president has not tired of the vel paalama (bridge built with creepers) analogy he has borrowed from Bertolt Brechtâ€™s The Caucasian Chalk Circle. He used it again last Wednesday to claim that he had safely carried endangered Mother Lanka across a precipitous abyss. From all that he said, it is clear Sri Lanka is nowhere out of the woods though he naturally presented the existing picture in the most favourable light possible.\nWeâ€™ve been granted considerable time to repay our bilateral debt installments for a period stretching from 2028 to 2043 â€œon concessional terms.â€ But there was no specific mention of â€˜haircutsâ€™ (reduction of capital payable) or reduced interest rates.\nAlso, the Official Creditors Committee (OCC) with whom the Paris deal was struck has called for details on the arrangement with China which too was signed last week. China was not a participant but was present as an observer during the OCC process. The information now sought by OCC, it has been said, is to ensure that all creditors are accorded comparable treatment.\nThe total picture will, no doubt, become clearer when the details of the arrangements that have been finalized are presented to parliament on July 2 when a special session has been summoned. The debate must necessarily present a more balanced picture that an ex parte statement.\nThere is no denying a forward movement on the economic front but that has come at a price. While the people are taxed to boost government revenue, there are no signs whatever of any serious effort of reducing numbers in the public service bloated by political patronage over a very long period of time. A large number of demands for substantial increases in public sector wages are on the table. But these are not demands that can be granted given the current state of the public exchequer.\nMeanwhile protests, strikes, water cannons and teargas are frequent occurrences. Thankfully money printing that seriously eroded peopleâ€™s savings is now no more so there can be no resort to the printing press which was a fact of life in the not so distant past.\nDo those demanding higher wages which the government cannot afford to grant realize that they are among the fortunate salaried and pensionable public servants? Nobody can deny that living on a government salary is not easy in the climate of ever rising prices. But do teachers, for example, ever think of their own shortcomings that have driven a large proportion of the school going population to the clutches of the private tuition industry? How many of them are beneficiaries of that industry?','2024-06-29','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/business-as-usual/'),(111,'Storm petrel pinioned','Monday 1st July, 2024\nThe law finally caught up with former MP Hirunika Premachandra on Friday. Having been found guilty of the abduction, wrongful detention and assault of a youth in December 2015, and sentenced to three-year RI, she is languishing behind bars. She is expected to appeal against her conviction. As a lawyer, Hirunika should have known better than to take the law into her own hands. What possessed her to commit the crime that has landed her in prison?\nHirunika and several others committed the aforesaid offences during the heyday of the UNP-led Yahapalana government. The UNP-led UNF was ensconced in power and President Maithripala Sirisena was going strong at the time. Hirunika, like the other young UNF MPs in the good books of the government leaders of the day may have thought she was above the law.\nThe problem with political power is that it goes to the heads of those who wield it, and have the same effect as intoxicants on them. Hence, the politicians of the party/coalition in power take leave of their senses and become oblivious to the consequences of their actions. One may recall how an otherwise amiable Ranjan Ramanayake behaved during the Yahapalana  government, telephoning and instructing even high-ranking police officers until he was humbled by the judiciary; he was imprisoned for contempt of court. The sobering reality dawned on him while he was serving time.\nHirunika has been a storm petrel of sorts. She was instrumental in exposing the defectus or vulnerability of the Rajapaksa fortress, as it were, and instilling anti-government protesters with confidence that it could be brought down like the Walls of Jericho. On 05 March 2022, she held a womenâ€™s protest near the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s Mirihana residence, and emboldened others to do likewise. She also staged a protest near the Presidentâ€™s House, Fort, on 06 July 2022, about three days before thousands of anti-government activists stormed the place, making President Rajapaksa head for the hills. She also incurred the wrath of the leaders of the incumbent dispensation by launching scathing verbal attacks on them and their close friends.\nThe killers of The Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickremetunge, popular sportsman, Wasim Thajudeen, and several others have not been brought to justice. The tardiness of police investigations into those crimes reminds us of a popular Avurudu cycling contest, where the slowest rider is adjudged the winner, and the contestants do their darndest to move as slow as possible. New foreign exchange control laws were introduced in 2017, and about 30 fraudsters who would have faced incarceration got away with the criminal offences they had committed under the previous Act, which had more teeth. Politicians who make a vulgar display of their wealth, despite their humble beginnings, have the last laugh when legal action is taken against them after regime changes.\nThe taxman looks the other way, and the national anti-graft commission is not equal to the task of prosecuting them properly. Above all, those who plunged the country into a bloodbath in the late 1980s, snuffing out thousands of lives, destroying public property worth billions of rupees, robbing banks and the public, and the perpetrators of equally heinous crimes in the name of counterterror have got off scot-free. A man who trespassed on a former Presidentâ€™s estate, and stole a few coconuts was shot the other day, but the Presidents, who are accused of indulging in corrupt practices, abusing power, jeopardising national security and ruining the economy, are looked after the by the State until they go the way of all flesh.\nThere are many politicians who are â€˜more equal than othersâ€™ before the law like the Pigs in Orwellâ€™s dystopian novella, Animal Farm. If only the law applied equally to everyone in this country.\nThe judicial gavel blow that has shocked Hirunika into realising that she is not above the law is most welcome, and it is hoped that it will serve as a deterrent for others of her ilk. However, on witnessing the prevailing culture of impunity, the selective law enforcement, and the shameful impotence of the long arm of the law and the state prosecutors vis-Ã -vis powerful politicians and their kith and kin, we cannot but echo the words of Mr. Bumble in Oliver Twistâ€” â€˜The law is an assâ€™.','2024-06-30','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/storm-petrel-pinioned/'),(112,'Enticing scent enthusiasts','The first fragrance carnival was held at the Body Shop store located in Colombo City Centre recently.

As the news sank in, a video of our long association played in my mindâ€™s eye of our time together in medical school and the many years as a medic working in Kurunegala and North London. In all those years what stands out is his unassuming modesty, helpful kindness and unstinting generosity.\nTitus had his entire education at St Josephâ€™s College Colombo. I first met him when I entered the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Colombo in 1962. He was then a final year student and well into student politics vying for positions in the Medical Students Union.\nAfter he qualified Titus completed his internship at the General Hospital Kurunegala. Thereafter he continued to work in that hospital for several more years. He was then well known for his bohemian lifestyle. On an evening Titus was often found in the upper or lower club playing bridge and socialising with friends. He was the life and soul of the many parties held at the house officersâ€™ quarters in Kurunegala where the amber nectar flowed so freely. Titus soon became a well-known and well-respected member of the town. He was so much a part of the Kurunegala scene that when he was transferred to a post in Colombo he was sorely missed.\nIn those days Titus had a keen interest in Forensic Medicine and was appointed AJMO in Colombo. His hard work, diligence and expertise was soon recognised by the Department of Health and he was offered a scholarship for further training in London. Although Titus completed his training he wanted a change to his career. He paid the Dept of Health for his scholarship and decided to stay on in London as his elder son required specialist medical care. Titus soon established himself as a histopathologist and worked in several hospital in London and also in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nAlthough he decided to live in the UK, for reasons beyond his control, he had a lifelong love for the country of his birth. He bought a house in Colombo for his retirement and was a regular visitor to Sri Lanka. Titus always dreamed of returning home to his roots to end his days. He had an encyclopaedic knowledge of the history of the country and it was such a pleasure to discuss the past with him. Titus generously supported several Sri Lankan charities.\nWhen I arrived in the UK in the early 1970â€™s I contacted Titus. He very kindly found me a job in the hospital where he worked in North London. Titus became a helpful companion to the many young Lankan doctors who worked at that hospital. It was here I got to know Janaki, his wife, and his two sons Sudarshan and Ranil. Like most Lankans, Titus was an inveterate cricket fan. He also loved an occasional flutter on the horses. I recall with great joy his animated descriptions of those missed opportunities for a handsome win.\nHis generosity with his time and his indefatigable work ethic made him fun to work with. Titusâ€™ forthrightness and sense of duty stood out and was well liked by all. When the need arose, he could be tough and combative. Wherever he worked he established a formidable reputation as a strong and decisive leader. He never shrank away from speaking his mind and knew where to draw the line. The way we stuck together made us a happy team.\nHis political ideology was distinctly left-wing. He believed firmly in social equality and egalitarianism. Titus cared deeply for the poor and the needy. He was a relentless advocate for social justice. There was never a dull moment listening to him, even when you disagreed with some of what he said. He was an incredibly kind and considerate man.\nWe have been friends for many years. I will always remember his down-to-earth manner and his complete lack of pretension. What stands out is his honesty, unimpeachable integrity and the ability to take life in his stride despite the many sad events and tragedies he had to endure. Whenever we met or chatted on the phone we reminisced our time together. He always enquired about mutual friends. Such was the strength of feeling for his old friends. I remember Titus with much affection and respect.\nFor many years his own health has not been at its best. Titus dealt with these issues with enormous courage and characteristic indomitable spirit. He remained cheerful and his enthusiasm for life never waned. Despite his regular visits to hospital for dialysis whenever I phoned, he was upbeat and never complained. This wonderful attitude to adversity is a beacon to us all. I admire greatly the love and care given to Titus over so many years by Janaki and Ranil (who is a GP). This allowed Titus to lead a happy and near normal life for so long.\nA lifelong practical joker, his was a life well lived. He was well educated, well-travelled and enjoyed all the good things in life. Despite the years he never lost his sense of fun and adventure, and we remember most fondly his â€˜joie de vivreâ€™. We are comforted by the memory of his long, full and inspiring life and so proud of his devotion to helping others. To me personally, his demise is an end of an era.\nMay he attain the ultimate Bliss of Nirvana\nDr Nihal D Amerasekera ','2024-07-06','Opinion',NULL,'http://island.lk/dr-titus-perera-a-life-remembered/'),(119,'Reportage of traumatic incidents pertaining to children','Letter sent to President Ranil Wickremesinghe on 05 July 2024\nThe members of the Council and the Child Protection Committee of the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians, together with the membership of the college, wish to submit a statement expressing our gravest concerns regarding the media (print and electronic) handling of incidents pertaining to children in the country.\nThe recent incident that took place on July 2, 2024, which led to the most unfortunate deaths of two young children, compels us to make this statement now and to appeal to all media organisations to refrain from sensationalising such acts. We note with utter dismay the detailed and sensationalised reporting of the said incident using CCTV coverage. The two children are easily identified in the clips shown. In trying to dramatise the incident, the rights of the children have been brutally violated and the basic principle of respecting the dead has been sadly and totally forgotten.\nChildren watching such incidents are known to be traumatised. We as Paediatricians, have had to help children who have presented with behaviour changes and psychosomatic symptoms following the exposure of these young minds to detailed traumatic experiences on TV and other forms of media in the past.\nFrequent and detailed reports of such acts can induce children to consider such incidents as â€œnormalâ€ behaviour in the young and undeveloped minds of individuals watching such reports. This is especially so in adolescents in whom impulse control is still immature. Adolescents are especially vulnerable to such influences and the tendency to imitate such behaviour is higher amongst them. For example, an association between sensationalised media reportage and subsequent increase in suicidal behaviour is well documented in the medical literature.\nIn addition, does the media have a right to disrespect the next of kin who are trying to grapple with a huge problem? Should their emotions and feelings not be considered? Two children from two families are dead. There are grieving parents, siblings, friends, teachers, etc. who are exposed to the details of the last few moments of the lives of these children on earth. What impact would this detailed reportage have on such individuals? Details of where the children lived are also being shown and highlighted. Such incidents of insensitive media reporting keep happening at regular intervals in the country. Media personnel should be more sensitive to such issues in future.\nWe implore you, as the Minister of Women and Child Affairs to look into this matter and take urgent remedial action for the future welfare of the children of our country.\nDr Kosala Karunaratne Dr Asvini D.

A large number of soldiers rushed in armoured vehicles and stormed the Murillo Square in the capital, La Paz, where key government institutions are located. Acting under the command of the head of the armed forces General Juan JosÃ© ZÃºÃ±iga, they attempted to force themselves into the Presidentâ€™s House by smashing down a wall. In a dramatic turn of events, the beleaguered President Louis Arce put up resistance intrepidly much to the surprise of everyone. He went on to appoint a new military commander, and the police arrested ZÃºÃ±iga. Order was restored in about three hours.\nBolivia is no stranger to military coups and has its share of generals with political ambitions. In 2019, the military stepped in to oust President Evo Morales following a disputed election outcome, paving the way for the appointment of an interim President. Arce became the President in 2020. Morales, who came to power in 2006, riding on a wave of popularity, endeared himself to the Bolivian public by undertaking to share in their suffering. He and his ministers took pay cuts and their approval rating shot up. But after being ensconced in power, Morales failed to live up to peopleâ€™s expectations and had to leave amidst public protests.\nInterestingly, General ZÃºÃ±iga told reporters, on Wednesday, that he had staged the â€˜coupâ€™ at the behest of President Arce himself! The incident has since come to be known as a â€˜self-coupâ€™ in some quarters. Whether the Generalâ€™s claim is true or false, one may not know, but the manner in which the â€˜coupâ€™ unfolded and ended, and the sangfroid of President Arce and his Cabinet have given rise to doubts and suspicions in the minds of Bolivians as well as others.\nSome political commentators are of the view that ZÃºÃ±iga has told the truth. They point out that President Arce is troubled by the prospect of having to face a popular uprising soon. His popularity is on the wane due to his governmentâ€™s inability to manage the floundering economy, which is reeling from a biting foreign exchange crisis caused by a drastic drop in gas exports. Wednesdayâ€™s â€˜coupâ€™ unified all those across the political spectrum, in Bolivia, including former President Morales, a bitter critic of the incumbent government; it has enabled Arce to rally public support, and shore up his image. ZÃºÃ±iga has also alleged Morales is planning to run for President despite a constitutionally-stipulated term limit and the latter has to be stopped.\nBolivia and other democratic nations heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday when the â€˜coupâ€™ came to an end, but socio-economic factors that have the potential to trigger an uprising and creating conditions for a real military intervention in the form of another coup remain in the Andean state, where public resentment is said to be palpable. Trouble is therefore far from over. Wednesdayâ€™s incident may be considered a foretaste of what is to come.\nAmbitious generals usually capitalise on public resentment and economic crises to project themselves as saviours and grab state power, as has been the experience of many countries in Latin America. They also do so at the instigation of foreign powers, the bloody overthrow of Salvador Allendeâ€™s democratically-elected, progressive government in Chile, one of Boliviaâ€™s neighbours, in 1973, being a case in point. The Bolivian Opposition and human rights groups have expressed fear that President Arce will use Wednesdayâ€™s incident to launch a campaign to suppress the Opposition. Arrests continue to be made, according to international media reports.\nAllâ€™s well that ends well, but it is hoped that the apparent coup in Bolivia will serve as a warning to all other nations which are facing similar political, social and economic problems, and that their leaders will refrain from provoking the public into staging uprisings and providing ambitious generals with opportunities to make forays into politics. The problem with political power is it is highly addictive like narcotics, and one who saviours it does not want to let go of it.','2024-06-28','Editorial',NULL,'http://island.lk/a-coup-that-was-not/'),(122,'The future of the plantation economy','I refer to the perceptive and informative article on â€œPolitics and the Plantation Ageâ€ by Anura Gunasekera (Sunday Island June 30).\nThe relationship of the upcountry plantation worker with his/her employer, the plantation companies, is vastly different from the days of indentured labour which prevailed in British times. The estate labour lived on the estates, they had a little land and residence facilities. They incurred no transport cost getting to work. More than one person from each family worked on the estate.\nIt is also evident in recent yeas that a significant number of the younger generation are employed outside the estate sector in places like Colombo. For the plantations to retain the work force on the estates, some incentives, not necessarily wage increases, might be offered. Plantation companies should explore the feasibility of profit sharing schemes with labour granting workers a stronger stake for working on the estates and improving productivity.\nThe current plantation system originated with the takeover of British owned estates in the mid-1970s. Over 150,000 acres were bought from the British owners through a transparent negotiating process. The government and the owners agreed to a price of British pound 42.5 per acre (Rs. 1,125 at that time). This was a good deal for Sri Lanka.\nWhat was less appropriate were the management systems that followed. Regional Plantation Companies were established to overcome these deficiencies. Once again a new policy framework has to be created for the plantation companies to operate for at least the next 50 years. Policies should encourage long term investment on estates, re-planting programs, modernization of factories etc.\nThis new policy framework should be developed through a consultation process involving government, the companies and labour.\nI came across a book, â€œTropical Pioneers â€“ Human Agency and Ecological Change in the Highlands of Sri Lanka 1800-1900â€ by James L.A. Webb Jr., published by Oxford University Press in New Delhi in 2002.

R. Jayewardene. Inspired by Prof. Cyril Ponnamperuma and Prof. Chandra Wickramasinghe. Beginning, it was located in a small office in Colombo before evolving into a comprehensive research institute located in Kandy.\nProf. Chandra Wickramasinghe, a prominent Sri Lankan-born astrophysicist and mathematician affiliated with Cardiff University, UK, advocated for establishing a scientific research institution in Sri Lanka dedicated to fundamental science and global scientific advancement. He served as the founding Director of IFS. Similarly, Prof. Cyril Ponnamperuma, a renowned Sri Lankan-born scientist and astrobiologist at the University of Maryland, USA, devoted himself to establishing a research institute in Sri Lanka to foster scientific excellence and collaboration. His international reputation was instrumental in gaining support for IFS.\nThis article aims to highlight NIFSâ€™s broader contributions. Recognising the complexity of its history, a recent initiative under Senior Prof. Lakshman Dissanayakeâ€™s leadershipâ€”a 200-page coffee table bookâ€”documents NIFSâ€™s proud achievements comprehensively. This publication reflects NIFSâ€™s enduring legacy and its pivotal role in shaping scientific discourse in Sri Lanka and beyond.\nFundamental studies, also known as basic research, focus on exploring fundamental principles, theories, or concepts within a specific field. They aim to establish a solid understanding of underlying principles that form the basis of a discipline, often driven by curiosity.\nAdvanced studies, on the other hand, delve deeper into a field beyond foundational knowledge. While fundamental studies lay the groundwork, advanced studies build upon this foundation, though the terms can vary in usage and may not always be interchangeable.\nApplied research, distinct from both fundamental and advanced research, addresses practical problems or issues in real-world contexts, aims to generate solutions or improvements with immediate applicability, enhancing processes, products, or services and focuses on practical outcomes that directly benefit society or industry, distinguishing it from the theoretical focus of fundamental and advanced studies.\nOutcomes from research projects usually focus on contributing new knowledge to academic or scientific communities, often through publications in scholarly journals. In contrast, research programmes may lead to broader impacts, including policy changes, improvements in service delivery, or other tangible benefits for targeted populations or sectors.\nOne exemplary case illustrating these concepts is the evolution of the Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF) Project at the National Institute of Fundamental Studies (NIFS) in Sri Lanka. Initiated under the directorship of Prof. Ponnamperuma, the BNF Project commenced with the recruitment of Prof. S. A. Kulasooriya in 1983. During the initial years, as Prof. Ponnamperuma secured resources and transformed the Hantane Hotel into a research institute, the project faced challenges but persisted with support from the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA).\nInitially funded by a grant from the United Nations University, the BNF Project started laboratory studies with three research assistants who later pursued postgraduate studies abroad. After a brief hiatus, collaboration with the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, revitalised the project under Prof. Kulasooriyaâ€™s leadership, culminating in several local researchers earning postgraduate degrees. The collaboration concluded successfully in 1997.â€™\nDr. Gamini Seneviratneâ€™s entry marked a significant shift towards studying non-symbiotic microbial associations with plantsâ€”a more advanced research direction. His pioneering work identified biofilm formations among beneficial microbes, leading to the concept of biofilm-based biofertilizers (BFBF) introduced globally by NIFS in 2003. Subsequent research confirmed the efficacy of BFBFs in reducing chemical fertiliser usage while increasing crop yields, prompting patent acquisition and further studies on their agricultural applications.\nThe success of the BFBF research prompted the establishment of the Microbial Biotechnology Unit (MBU) at NIFS, consolidating ongoing projects under a unified framework. By 2009, field trials with the Tea Research Institute aimed to halve chemical fertiliser use, showcasing the practical impact of NIFSâ€™s research endeavors on sustainable agriculture.\nIn summary, the journey from the BNF Project to the MBU exemplifies how research projects can evolve into comprehensive programmes that address complex challenges through innovative scientific approaches. NIFSâ€™s contributions in microbial biotechnology highlight its pivotal role in advancing sustainable agriculture and fostering scientific excellence in Sri Lanka and beyond.\nâ€˜Samantha Kumarasinghe, a former science graduate from the University of Peradeniya, saw the potential of Biofilm-Biofertilizer (BFBF) technology and acquired its patent. He established Lanka Bio-Fertilizers (Private) Limited (LBF) to manufacture and distribute the fertiliser globally. Initially targeted for tea cultivation, the technology faced opposition from conventional agriculturists and institutes like the Tea Research Institute (TRI). Despite scepticism, field trials proved successful across various crops, leading to endorsements from the Department of Agriculture and TRI for rice and tea cultivation by 2017. Global scientists also recognised the innovation, developing similar biofilms and acknowledging NIFSâ€™s pioneering research.\nWhat is impact and impact pathways\nAccording to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) definition for The Research Excellence Framework (REF) is the new system for assessing the quality of research in UK higher education institutes; â€œImpact is defined as â€œan effect on, change or benefit to the economy, society, culture, public policy or services, health, the environment or quality of life, beyond academiaâ€.\nThe Microbial Biotechnology Unit (MBU) research as a classic case study to explain impact and impact pathways.\nThe research conducted by NIFS has significantly impacted both academic and non-academic sectors, particularly in Sri Lankaâ€™s agriculture:\nAcademic Impact: NIFS has advanced scientific understanding by emphasising the role of microorganisms in soil fertility, addressing a notable knowledge gap in Sri Lanka due to limited focus on soil microbiology within institutions like the Department of Agriculture. Training initiatives led by Professors Kulasooriya and Seneviratne at universities such as Peradeniya, Rajarata, and Wayamba have improved teaching on soil microbiology, focusing on topics like biological nitrogen fixation and microbial biofilms. This academic outreach has integrated concepts like BFBF into university curricula, broadening educational perspectives on sustainable crop production.\nThe programme has also trained numerous researchers, including Malkanthi Gunatilleke and Dr. Chandani Mudannayake, who have obtained postgraduate degrees and contributed to global research. Their work has fostered cross-disciplinary approaches, particularly in developing multi-microbial soil conditioners and Rhizobial Biofertilizers. These innovations have been recognised internationally, with Prof. Seneviratne listed among the top 2% scientists worldwide by Elsevier/Stanford.\nNon-Academic Impact: Commercialisation efforts, supported by patents and partnerships with industry, highlight significant economic impacts. Lanka Bio Fertilizers (Private) Limited has established production facilities and created jobs, demonstrating the viability of biofertilizers like BFBF in both local and export markets. These initiatives aim to reduce Sri Lankaâ€™s dependency on imported chemical fertilisers, potentially saving millions in foreign exchange annually.\nEnvironmental sustainability is another crucial outcome, with biofertilisers offering eco-friendly alternatives that mitigate environmental pollution associated with conventional agriculture. The acceptance of BFBF and Rhizobial Biofertilizers by policy makers underscores their role in sustainable agriculture, aligning with evidence-based policy-making initiatives. The Sectorial Oversight Committee on Food Security and Agriculture has recognised NIFSâ€™s leadership in ecofriendly agriculture, supporting national programmes in collaboration with agricultural authorities to promote these technologies among farmers.\nIn summary, NIFSâ€™s research has not only enriched academic discourse on soil microbiology but also catalysed practical advancements in agriculture, fostering economic resilience and environmental stewardship in Sri Lankaâ€™s farming communities.\nAttracting returns for R&D investment\nNIFS income from BFBF royalty significantly increasing over the last few years During 2022 and 2023 the NIFS has received 9 million rupees from sales of Rhizobium fertiliser. It has also received 24 million rupees as royalty from BFBF.\nChanging organisational cultures and practices\nThis detailed case study amply demonstrates that it is not a strange coincidence, that the National Institute for Fundamental Studies, had advanced from its â€œmandateâ€. Certainly, â€œitâ€™s not a retrograde step grossly deviating from its mandate and entertaining practical projects best carried out elsewhereâ€.\nFundamental research, advanced research and applied research leading to implementation research through multidisciplinary collaborations for impact finally brings benefits to the people beyond academia.\nIncreasing public engagement with research and related societal issues;\nletâ€™s return once again to the public engagement and involvement.\nEngaging the public and stakeholders at every stage of the research cycle is crucial. Social sciences play a pivotal role in this engagement, ensuring community involvement and support. Despite a historical exclusion, reinstating social sciences within IFS ACT has been a priority under my chairmanship. This approach includes organising farmer community events for awareness and support, integrating lived experiences into research design, and collaborating with stakeholders to co-produce research agendas.\nMoving forward, conducting studies using social science methods like focus groups and interviews will be essential. These efforts aim to address challenges and barriers, informing the development of an eco-friendly fertiliser policy for Sri Lanka, contingent on securing necessary funding.\nTherefore, we conclude, research for peopleâ€™s benefit is the moral story and such research is paramount for national development.','2024-07-04','Opinion',NULL,'http://island.lk/what-is-research-why-do-research-and-for-whos-benefit/'),(124,'Kinder government reaction to economic distress would evoke better public response','by Jehan Perera\n\nWith less than a month before presidential elections are called, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has highlighted the success of his presidency as rescuing Sri Lanka from its international bankruptcy status that prevents it from doing business with the rest of the world.Â  Â The signing of the agreement on international debt restructuring for USD 5.8 billion with the Official Creditor Committee consisting of several foreign governments that have given bilateral loans to Sri Lanka was celebrated in numerous ways.Â The president himself made a speech to the nation and firework exhibitions took place in various towns to mark the occasion.Â  The president made it clear that he was the architect of Sri Lankaâ€™s economic recovery.Â This puts upon him a greater responsibility to engage with the people, listen to them and explain to them what it all means.\nÂ President Wickremesinghe said, â€œI believed in my ability to save our country and its people from the economic abyss. I had a comprehensive work plan and a deep understanding of the strategies that other nations had employed to emerge from similar crises. Furthermore, I had faith that with my planned policies and dedication, the economy could be revitalised.â€ The signing of the debt restructuring agreement received immediate plaudits from the countries that matter most to Sri Lanka at this time.Â  US Ambassador Julie Chung welcomed the news stating â€œThis is a positive step forward in Sri Lankaâ€™s economic recovery and resilience, helping build more confidence in Sri Lankaâ€™s fiscal environment. The US encourages Sri Lanka to continue the reform process, adopting transparent and sustainable changes that foster long-term prosperity and growth.â€Â  Similarly, Japan, India and the IMF also expressed their satisfaction with the progress that Sri Lanka was making.\nHowever, there was also a second agreement that Sri Lanka signed with Chinaâ€™s Exim Bank for USD 4.2 billion which has caused concern among the same parties that congratulated the President and the Sri Lankan negotiating team on reaching agreement with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) which did not include China.Â  They have demanded â€œcomparability of treatmentâ€ with other creditors, including China. In particular, they have requested details of Sri Lankaâ€™s other debt deals, and â€œall information necessary for the OCC to ensure comparability of treatmentâ€.Â  The details of the negotiations in both cases are not known, but will most probably be revealed as the parliamentary debate takes place this week.Â  This tension reflects the serious problem of lack of transparency in the governmentâ€™s financial transactions that runs across the board.\n\nNo Haircut\nPresident Wickremesinghe was cryptic when he said, â€œWith these agreements, we will be able to defer all bilateral loan instalment payments until 2028. Furthermore, we will have the opportunity to repay all the loans on concessional terms, with an extended period until 2043.â€ He did not say what these concessional terms were nor did he mention what the â€œhaircutâ€ would be.Â  While the amount that would be subject to concessional repayment is USD 5.8 billion the total foreign debt was in the region of USD 40 billion at the time of the economic collapse in 2022. Last year when the government was negotiating with the creditors there was optimism that a â€œhaircutâ€ in the range of 30 percent would be possible.Â  Specific to debt restructuring, a haircut is the reduction of outstanding interest payments or a portion of a bond payable that will not be repaid.\nAccording to research studies done by international researchers in the field, creditors offering debtors concessional terms in order to facilitate the repayment of loans taken is a common occurrence.Â  In this context, the international support given to the Sri Lankan government seems to be much less than was expected, or even what is fair.Â  A research study published last month in Germany states â€œWe study sovereign external debt crises over the past 200 years, with a focus on creditor losses, or â€œhaircutsâ€. Our sample covers 327 sovereign debt restructurings with external private creditors over 205 default spells since 1815. Creditor losses vary widely (from none to 100%), but the statistical distribution has remained remarkably stable over two centuries, with an average haircut of around 45 percent.â€ Graf von Luckner C.M. Meyer J. Reinhart C.M. Trebesch C., Publication Date, 06/2024,Â https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/sovereign-haircuts-200-years-of-creditor-losses-33019/Â  The expressions of international support would be more meaningful if they contribute to getting Sri Lanka much better terms for its debt restructuring.\nDue to the lack of information about the benefits to Sri Lanka of a reduction in the debt burden that would make an immediate impact on their lives, the presidentâ€™s victory speech did not gain much traction among the general public.Â  The public displays of celebratory fireworks in many parts of the country did not obtain any significant public participation. The fact is that the economic life of the people will not change either immediately or even in the short term, except marginally through changes in the controlled price of some commodities such as occurred with petrol. Those whose salaries have remained stagnant over the past two years have to cope with basic costs of living that have increased two to three-fold.Â Â  Unlike Kenya where mobs went on to the streets to protest against the increases in the cost of living and high taxes, the vast majority of Sri Lankan people have borne their difficulties in silence and in the privacy of their homes.\n\nStock Answer\nOrganised groups such as student unions and trade unions, however, are bringing the grievances of people out into the open.Â  The teachers protest which was ended by tear gas and water cannons fired upon them by the police was an example. Dr Ahilan Kadirgamar, who teaches economics at the University of Jaffna has written, in his Kuppi Talk column in The Island of 25 June)â€ â€œThe IMF-led austerity programme, despite many promises to preserve social spending, inevitably leads to cuts in the real value of social spending, as reflected in the recently released Finance Ministry Annual Report for 2023. Between 2021 and 2023 the cost of living in Sri Lanka increased by 100 percent, or if we look at it in dollar terms, the value of the Sri Lankan rupee declined by fifty percent from Rs 200 to Rs 300 per dollar. However, during this period the nominal spending increase for general education was only 22.5 percent and for higher education was a mere 13.1 percentâ€ as against the 100 percent inflation.\nIn simple terms, there is no money left in this depleted education budget for salary increases to be made, or for the government to even keep to the commitments it made to teachers in the past.Â  Dr Kadigamar further notes that â€œFor decades, Sri Lanka has been reducing its spending on education. In fact, expenditure on education has spiraled downwards over the decades from close to 5 percent of GDP in 1970 to 1.2 percent in 2022, one of the lowest today in the world.â€Â  The governmentâ€™s current approach to education, as spelled out by the president, is to hand it over to the private sector.Â  However, the withdrawal of the state from the provision of education services will be injurious to those from less well-off families in the context of the commercialisation of education as a profit making business and not a social service.Â  In a general context of grave economic hardship there is a need for more government investment in education for the economically disadvantaged and not less.\nTeachers came out onto the streets in their thousands to protest last week against the governmentâ€™s failure to address their concerns. There is no question that teachers are today a grossly underpaid sector though tasked with educating the younger generations to meet the challenges of the future. They were dispersed by the security forces with tear gas and water cannons. This harsh treatment of protestors has become the stock answer of the government to those who wish to make use of their democratic rights to question the government and to gather together to do so. It would be better if the president, as the key person behind the economic transformation of the country, were to talk to the protestors or at least to their leaders, hear them out and let them vent their grievances. When signing agreements that will bind the country for the future it is important for the government to take the people, and the opposition political parties, into its confidence and seek to obtain their support as well. This is the only way that solutions will last the test of time and be sustainable.\n\n','2024-07-02','Opinion',NULL,'http://island.lk/kinder-government-reaction-to-economic-distress-would-evoke-better-public-response/'),(125,'Nande Palihakkara 1948-2024','We were a bunch of 220 excited schoolboys, joining Royal College in 1959.

In the Oxford Dictionary it is defined as an â€œaction of forgiving or remission of the legal consequences of an offence or convictionâ€. Some argue that the power to grant a pardon is a check on the powers of the judiciary rectifying any miscarriage of justice. But this executive power unchecked could result in the abuse of power. \nIn recent times, President Sirisena granted two pardons â€“ one within six months and the other within nine days of relinquishing office while President Gotabay Rajapaksa granted two pardons â€“ one within four months of becoming president and the other seven months after he received a two thirds majority in Parliament.\nThe practice of giving Presidential pardons to political friends came to the limelight when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed a notorious Buddhist monk Ven. Galaboda Eththe Gnanasara who had received a pardon from President Sirisena earlier, as the Head of the Presidential Task Force to study and prepare a law to implement the concept â€œOne Country One Lawâ€, as though the monk was an epitome of righteousness.\nIn view of the controversial manner in which Presidents Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa had granted pardons, the proposals to tighten presidential prerogative in granting pardons was a strident demand during the course of the recent Aragalaya. However, the course of action provided in the 19th amendment for the Supreme Court to review pardons by way of Fundamental Rights applications, has become a positive feature in the hands of our independent Supreme Court which has maintained checks and balances on the executive power thereby preventing a culture of injustice undermining the Rule of Law.\nSome murders highlight brutality and arrogance of the accused when committing crimes. Such acts bring immense agony, pain and suffering to the victims and their loved ones. That is why a president is expected to intervene with utmost care when using his prerogative to grant a pardon. In doing so, he is obliged to consider the gravity of the offence, the role of the police in containing crime, the specific role of the AGs department and the judiciary in imparting justice and not be arbitrary, unreasonable and ignore the public interest.\nIn Britain, the courts have jurisdiction to review the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of the Monarch to grant a pardon â€œin accordance with accepted public Law principlesâ€. In India too, the Indian Supreme Court has held that in a landmark judgement in Epuru Sudhakar and Another vs Government of Andhra Pradesh , that the Indian Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to review presidential pardons.\nThe request for a pardon is generally forwarded by the Prisons Department based on good behaviour, age and medical condition etc. Of the prisoner. Therefore it plays a leading role in deciding on a convictâ€™s life in prison. Also, the prisoner himself can appeal for a pardon. \nArticle 34 (1) of the Constitution, while stating that the President may in the case of any offender convicted by any court (a) grant a pardon either free or subject to lawful conditions, (b) grant any respite for an indefinite period, of the execution of any sentence, (c) substitute a less severe form of punishment imposed on the offender or (d) remit the whole or any part of the punishment imposed, has incorporated a Proviso to the Article 34 which states that : â€˜where the offender has been condemned to death, the President shall call for the report from the Judge who tried him and shall forward that report for AGâ€™s advice and thereafter the President shall submit all to the Minister of Justice, who shall forward the report with his recommendations to the President.â€™ \nPresidential pardons for offenses not amounting to murder\nPresidential pardons are a regular feature in cases where prisoners are convicted of minor offences. Such pardons are granted marking special events like Vesak, Christmas and Independence Day. In such cases of non-murder offences, pardons are given mainly during national festivals. According to statistics available in the Ministry of Justice, Presidents J R Jayewardene, R Premadasa, D B Wijetunga released 72 convicts during 1978 to 1994. The first President J R Jayewardene pardoned gangster Gonawela Sunil in 1983 convicted for raping a 14-year-old girl in 1982. On that occasion, The President of the BASL, A C (Bunty) de Zoysa protested strongly. Zoysa was a working Committee member of the UNP at the time but had the guts to clash with his party leader. However, his protests were ignored.\nThis rapist gangster is alleged to have executed a plan to massacre 53 Tamil Prisoners in 1983. ( N Jordan, Retd Deputy Prisons Chief- CDN, 16 Nov. 1999 ). President Premadasa pardoned Manori Daniels, a teacher in a government school in the Batticaloa District and a mother of two, who was convicted of aiding and abetting the LTTE bomber Gagendran who caused the death of 40 civilians in a car bomb blast in Maradana, on November 9. 1987. She was given a six year sentence in October 1989. (President Premadasa expected the LTTE to reciprocate his goodwill. But as history has recorded, LTTE never reciprocated gestures of goodwill shown by either Presidents Ranasinghe Premadasa or subsequently Mahinda Rajapaksa).\nPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa pardoned 10 former members of the Presidential Security Division ( PSD ) who were sentenced for over four years after they were found guilty of assaulting and causing bodily harm to a famous husband wife duo because they sang at an opposition political party musical show.\nPresidential pardons where death sentences are pronounced\nIn murder convictions, the presiding judge always files a report. This report is available to the President and to the Committee sitting on the future of such convicts. If a presidential pardon is granted to a murder convict in death row, in most instances the death sentence is reduced to life imprisonment.\nâ€œLife sentenceâ€ means 20 years. From time to time, the term gets reduced due to good behaviour, age, medical condition etc. Finally, the prisoner is sent home before the reduced term is reached but under a supervisory licence and required to be of good behaviour.\nDuring President Chandrika Kumaratungaâ€™s presidency, a policy was formulated and is being followed today where a committee comprising of a retired judge as chairman, an official from the AGâ€™s and Prisons Departments, Ministry of Justice and a psychologist sit in committee to decide on the future of a prisoner on whom a death sentence is passed. The committee decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.\nAbuse of presidential power\nBut with time, unchecked presidential power began to corrupt, resulting in abuse of power. It expanded to instances where murderers were pardoned with impunity.\nIn the first of such cases was President Mahinda Rajapaks  pardoning in March 2009, Mary Juliet Monica Fernando (a ministerâ€™s wife) convicted of a double murder in 2005. In view of the controversies surrounding the impunity with which President Mahinda Rajapaksa used his Executive powers in general, the Yahapalanaya government enacted the 19th amendment, in which provision was made for the Supreme Court jurisdiction to review the official decisions of a President by way of a Fundamental Rights application under Article 35 (1) of the Constitution. As a result, a way to check presidential excesses was made available to the people, thereby upholding the doctrine of â€œSeparation of Powersâ€ in the Constitution.\nDespite the enactment of the said 19th Amendment by his own government, President Sirisena granted pardons to: (1) controversial Buddhist monk and Secretary General of the militant Bodu Bala Sena in May 2019. He had been sentenced to six years for contempt of court after failing in his appeal to the Court of Appeal in August 2019. This pardon was granted a mere six months before Sirisena relinquished office.\n(2) to Jude Anthony Jayamaha on November 9, 2019, a mere nine days before he relinquished office despite the Supreme Court having dismissed Jayamahâ€™s appeal confirming the death sentence. \nIn the face of severe criticism, a press release from the presidentâ€™s office on November 11, 2019 stated that Ven Athuraliya Rathana Thero moved in the matter in writing and made verbal representation with Ven Baddegama Samitha Thero, Ven Karandawela Punnaratana Thero, Ven Balangoda Buddhagosha Thero and Catholic Bishop Raymond Wickramasinghe. They appealed to the President to pardon Jayamaha. Many allegations were made about large sums of money being paid to various persons for the services rendered but, astonishingly no formal inquiry was made to find out the truth about these allegations made by the presidentâ€™s media division, although some of those named were MPs.\nAggrieved by the presidential pardon, a F R application was filed by â€˜The Women and Media Collectiveâ€™ challenging the use of the presidentâ€™s constitutional power to grant a pardon as he does not have the freedom to grossly violate the Rule of Law, equity and rationality and has no right to recklessly disregard the sensitivities and sensibilities of the aggrieved family from whom a young life was taken away in a gruesome murder. When the case was taken for hearing, the court was informed by the Controller of Immigration and Emigration that after Jayamaha was granted the pardon, he had travelled overseas and is not to be found. The SC ordered overseas travel ban until further consideration.\nA three-member Bench delivering the judgement found President Sirisena had intentionally violated the constitution and ordered him to pay Rs 1 m each to the parents of the victim and Rs 1 m to the petitioner and directed the AG to take tangible measures to secure the custody of the Jayamaha.\nDespite mud in the face of the outgoing President Sirisena, the newly elected President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, also misused his constitutional privilege. Armed with a massive 6.9m voter mandate, he gave two pardons: (1) to an Army Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake on March 26, 2020 â€“ a mere four  months after he assumed office despite a five Judge Bench of the Supreme Court affirming on April 25, 2019 the death sentence and (2) to former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva on June 24, 2021- a mere seven months after receiving a two thirds majority in Parliament.\nIt is heartening to observe that the Supreme Court has asserted its authority by judicially checking the presidential prerogative to grant pardons. It has already issued an interim order, nullifying the presidential pardon granted to Duminda Silva and fixed September 4 to hear the FR case challenging the pardon given to former soldier Sunil Ratnayake.\nIn the case of Duminda Silva, The Colombo High Court imprisoned this controversial parliamentarian for life in 2016 over the murder of MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed a highly controversial Presidential Commission to investigate incidents of political victimization which recommended the release of Duminda Silva. The President promptly granted a special pardon to Duminda Silva in June 2021. But in May 2022, the SC issued an interim order directing the CID to place Duminda Silva under prison custody and impound his passport.\nOne of the most obnoxious and controversial acts of President Gotabaya Rajapakse was to grant Lance Corporal Suni Ratnayake a pardon for the murder of eight Tamil civilians in December 2000. This act of the president after the war victory and at a time the country required reconciliation to rebuild the countryâ€™s economy after a 30 year war and reconcile and integrate the Tamil community was not expected of a Head of a State and was a stab in the back of reconciliation.\nFortunately, The SC has granted leave to appeal in five FR cases filed by the family members of the victims and the Centre for Policy Alternatives, challenging the former Presidentâ€™s decision to pardon former soldier and directed service of notices on the former president and Ratnayake to be present at the hearing in September 2024, as both were unrepresented in court.\nThe people should recall the facts of this heinous crime and the court verdict, to understand the gravity of the crime committed on so many innocent lives. Lance Corporal Sunil Ratnayake, with a 20 strong military unit of the Gajaba Regiment was airlifed to Mirusavil, Jaffna, on December 18, 2000. The murder of eight villagers took place just one day later on December 19, 2000.\nHe was sentenced to death by a High Court Trial at Bar in June 2015 after almost 15 months since the date of the crime. A five judge Bench sitting in appeal in the Supreme Court affirmed the sentence on April 25, 2019. The court held that the prosecution had established all eight counts of murder (11-18) and count of causing hurt to Maheswaran ( 19 ) and confirmed the death sentence.\nBriefly the facts are as follows: When the fighting intensified in 2000 and the LTTE overran Elephant Pass in April 2000, the army retreated to Ellathumaduwal and the villagers dispersed from their village Mirusavil to close by villages due to stray shells falling nearby. But the villagers developed the habit of visiting their homes in Mirusavil to clean their houses and collect whatever produce they can and return before dusk.\nOn December 18, 2000, a military unit of the Gajaba Regiment was airlifted to Mirusavil. On December 19, eight villagers comprising a five-year-old toddler accompanying his father, two 13- and 15-year-old boys accompanying their fathers visited their homes on cycles, as villagers used to do.\nOn this fateful day at about 4 pm, when the eight villagers were getting ready to return with whatever produce they had collected, the five-year-old had pestered the father to pluck a guava fruit from a nearby tree. The father not having the heart to disappoint his son, had with the others on their cycles, gone towards the fruit tree. But they were confronted on the way by two soldiers â€“ one with a firearm and the other with a knife. After an initial questioning, one soldier went back and returned with four other military men who together had severely assaulted all the men with blunt weapons. When witness Maheswaran (only surviving witness) regained consciousness, they blindfolded him with his sarong and threw him over a fence. His sarong was entangled on the fence and he lay injured in his underwear.\nSubsequent events narrated by Maheswaran, disclosed how he escaped not knowing the fate of the others and met his father who was searching for him. His mother to whom the story was related, had complained to the political office of the EPDP. Subsequently he was admitted to the Chandigar hospital. On information and pressure, the army authorities promptly started investigating the incident.\nDuring the search of the area by the Military Police with Maheswaran, a few soldiers accompanied by Officer Commanding the unit Sgt Ranasinghe stationed about 50 meters away from the scene of the crime, had approached the search party. Seeing them Maheswaran had spontaneously cried out pointing at two soldiers as the two who had severely beaten them up. They were Lance Corporal Ratnayake and Private Kumarasinghe.\nSubsequently at a Magisterial inquiry, five persons were identified among whom were the first accused appellant Ratnayake and Kumarasinghe. On court orders, a search revealed the bodies and the bicycles of all the eight unfortunate civilians killed and buried at a spot shown by Ratnayake â€“ the accused appellant. The relatives had identified the bodies.\nThey were charged for unlawful assembly and murder and causing hurt to the only eyewitness Maheswaran and deceased Raviwarnam.\nThe entire case was based on circumstantial evidence and lay on the credibility of the evidence of the only eye witness, Maheswaran. The court had observed that the witness was traumatized and had even refused to go with the army to identify places if not accompanied by EPDP and ICRC officials.\nMedical evidence confirmed the assault to be compatible with Maheswaranâ€™s testimony. The doctor who did the post mortem examination stated that all bodies had injuries by assault and cut injuries around the back of either side of the neck, which severed the two main arteries and were necessarily fatal. The prosecution had contended that no firearms were used in murdering, as the killers were aware of the war situation in the area and took precautions not to make a noise by firing.\nThe defence argued that Maheswaranâ€™s evidence had contradictions and omissions. But both courts held that they were all minor and insignificant. The SC further observed that the witness was a Tamil with no knowledge of Sinhala. His evidence was translated into Sinhala writing and some discrepancies may have occurred.\nThe SC commented that in his dock statement the accused appellant had admitted that he was present in the area on this fateful day. The SC having considered the totality of all the evidence, circumstantial and otherwise, came to the conclusion that: (1) there was irresistible inference that it was appellant and his group of men that had inflicted the fatal injuries to all deceased and (2) from the nature of injuries, it was safe to conclude that the injuries were inflicted with an intention to cause death.\nIt is hoped that the agitation launched by civil society will succeed and ensure that the process of granting a pardon by the Head of State will be strengthened by unambiguous constitutional and legal provisions, so that such a privilege is retained but not abused for collateral reasons.','2024-07-06','Politics',NULL,'http://island.lk/presidential-pardons-an-unchecked-executive-power/'),(129,'S.W.R.D Bandaranaike â€“ (1899- 1959): laid low by six bullets from an assassinâ€™s weapon','(Excerpted from Selected Journalism by HAJ Hulugalle)\nSir Solomon Dias Bandaranaike who was Maha Mudaliyar or Chief Interpreter to the Governor was born on May 22, 1862. Sir Solomon acted as extra A.D.C. to His Majesty King George V of England during the latterâ€™s visit to Ceylon as Duke of York in 1901. He was well known in sporting circles and a proprietary planter.\nProfessor S A Pakeman of the Ceylon university wrote of the son: â€œBandaranaike was a clever young man, the only son of Sir Solomon Dias Bandaranaike, the Maha Mudaliyar, head of the leading upper-class family in the low-country. The Maha Mudaliyar was, technically, the â€˜chief native interpreterâ€™, a ceremonial position of great dignity. In this capacity he was closely connected for formal and ceremonial purposes with the Governors, and named his son `West Ridgewayâ€™ after one of them.\nâ€œHe was in fact a land owner on a large scale. His autobiography, Remembered Yesterdays, throws much light on the life and ways of thinking of his class. He was a man highly respected by people of all races.\nâ€œHe sent his son to Christ Church College, Oxford, where he read Western classics and became Junior Treasurer of the Oxford Union, having a natural gift for speaking.\nâ€œOn his return to Ceylon he entered municipal politics and then national politics. The way he was brought up meant that he had little acquaintance with the Sinhalese language but he made himself fluent in that tongue, though he admitted later that he could neither read nor write the script with any ease.\nâ€œHis point of view differed completely from that of his father, and he became an enthusiastic nationalist, with emphasis on Sinhalese primacy.â€\nDr. Howard Wriggins, a Professor from Princeton in the United States in his book Ceylon: Dilemma of a Nation, with less first-hand knowledge and depth of understanding wrote: â€œOne fundamental rift within the UNP sprang from the problem of succession. When the Sinhala Maha Sabha was brought into the UNP, it was generally understood that Mr. Bandaranaike as second of the largest component of the UNP would succeed Mr. D. S. Senanayake who was expected to step down from the party leadership in the near future.\nâ€œBut Mr. Senanayake did not step down. It became clear as time went on that Mr. Senanayake was not sure that the post should be reserved for Mr. Bandaranaike. On the contrary, it became clear that he was grooming his nephew, Major John Kotalawala, for the post instead. These manoeuvres were explicable as part of a long-standing competition between the Senanayake and Bandaranaike family clans.â€\nDr. Wriggins continues that â€œthere was little trust and confidence between them. Hence when the United National Party was formed, with Mr. D. S. Senanayake as the dominant figure, it was not surprising to those who knew the family background of these men that Mr. Bandaranaike should have been unwilling to subordinate himself to the elder Senanayake.\nâ€œOn the other hand, Mr. Bandaranaike and others came to feel that the elder Senanayake did not trust Mr. Bandaranaike. It appeared that Mr. D. S. Senanayake kept foreign policy matters to himself, a circumstance already formalized in the Constitution in which the portfolio of External Affairs was merged with the office of the Prime Minister. With this interpretation in mind, it was not surprising that the Sinhala Maha Sabha, the creation of Bandaranaike, was not dissolved; nor was his resignation from the Cabinet in 1951 unexpected.â€\nBandaranaike himself did not wish to separate the Ministry of External Affairs from that of the Prime Minister in 1956. Wriggins says in successive pages that â€œit became evident that he (Senanayake) was grooming his nephewâ€ and that he â€œbegan to build up his son.â€ In fact his son was not interested in the post and, as Wriggins himself says, â€œfinally accepted with reluctance and after much indecision.â€\nIt would do less than justice to the memory of Senanayake and Bandaranaike to say that the break between the two leaders in 1951 was solely or largely due to family rivalries. They were both men of stature, devoted to the interests of the country but their background, make-up, intellectual processes and philosophy were different.\nBandaranaike was a remarkable speaker, apt to be carried away by the exuberance of his oratory, but he was skillful in drawing fine distinctions as when, after his resignation, it came to defining his position between the United National Party and the Marxists, both Trotskyites and Leninists, with whom he was ready to make electoral pacts to dethrone the UNP. As for Senanayake, although social reform and economic development were his aims, he was not known to have used the word â€˜socialismâ€™ and could not quite make out what Ceylonese speakers meant when they advocated â€˜socialism.â€™\nHulugalle with Mr and Mrs Bandaranaike\nThe respective contributions of Senanayake and Bandaranaike to the modern history of Ceylon were, in a sense, complementary. The older man won independence for Ceylon, gave the country stable government and a viable administrative machine and identified agriculture, especially food production, as the principal target of Ceylonâ€™s economic development.\nIf anybody seeks a monument to Senanayakeâ€™s work in the sphere of agriculture he has only to look round and see the irrigation works he constructed and the hundreds and thousands of acres of new land he helped to bring under cultivation in the sparsely populated areas of Ceylon. He appreciated British political traditions and sought the friendship of the people of Great Britain and of the Dominions. He was a practical man, patient, clear-sighted, friendly and prone to estimate any project solely by its practical bearing on the interests of the common people in Ceylon.\nAdmirers have compared Senanayake and Bandaranaike with Patel and Nehru in India. Bandaranaike had Nehruâ€™s educational background, the same western culture, the power of speech and egalitarian perspectives, a sheltered life before plunging into the political maelstrom and a vague vision of the future. Senanayake on the other hand, was like Patel, a man of action, with a deep knowledge of human nature and human weakness and a vision deeply grounded on the hard facts of life.\nThough repeatedly he disclaimed Marxist doctrines, Bandaranaikeâ€™s politics were radical and had socialist overtones. He set out to build a new society which suited the genius of the Ceylonese people in the context of a changing world. To do this he had to take note of the new political status of the country.\nIn a speech shortly after his resignation, Bandaranaike said: â€œBut how did freedom come? It came not after a fight upon definite principles. policies and programmes, but it really came in the normal course of events, that is, attempts to persuade Commissions sent from England to grant this little bit or that little bit extra; and finally, in the wake of freedom that was granted to countries like India, Pakistan and Burma. Our Soulbury Constitution was altered to extend to us the same type of Dominion Status. There was no fight for that freedom which involved a fight for principles, polices and programmes which could not be carried out unless that freedom was obtained. No. It just came overnight. We just woke up one day and we were told, â€˜You are a Dominion now.\nâ€œWhat was the psychological effect that was created, particularly among those who in the previous 15 or 20 years had been working the other Constitution, who came into the free Parliament, many of whom became Ministers of this free Constitution? The psychological effect was to go along the same road. That was quite understandable. It did not involve any dishonesty or some deliberate wrong-doing on the part of any individual. That was the natural way one thought in those circumstances.\nâ€œIt is quite easy, for instance if, after the Englishman has made a road, when he is driving his car along the road, he suddenly stops and says, â€˜Well, look here my dear fellow, I am getting off this driving seat; you can sit there; I shall sit behind, for the driver to continue along the same road with the same thinking and acting in the same way.\nâ€œWe are thinking on different planes, probably all of us bona fide. While one set of people were thinking on that line, another set were thinking quite differently. I, for instance, was thinking that freedom meant something much more than that, particularly that in the context of world affairs today this free country, with great difficulty and trouble, had to cut a new free road through the forest and to make its own vehicle travel along that final goal of prosperity and happiness which every free country has the right to expect. That was the psychology out of which this situation has arisen.â€\nBandaranaike went on to say that the backbone of the Government from which he had resigned was â€œthe reactionary capitalistic elementsâ€ and that â€œa tendency in the Cabinet system towards a form of dictatorship seems to have unquestionably developed.â€\nBandaranaike was already mobilizing the various elements in the country dissatisfied with Senanayakeâ€™s domination of the Government and of Parliament. The argument that the UNP was supported mainly by reactionary capitalistic elements was a useful card to play when the poor were in a majority and had the power of the vote to overturn any Government. Bandaranaike foresaw that, in a developing country with a fast-growing population under a system of adult franchise, political power must necessarily pass to the masses.\nâ€œHis own political future, as he saw it, depended on his ability to give leadership to the new generations of voters. In a speech made in the House of Representatives on July 30, 1952, he said: â€œThe feudal system itself gave way and broadened out into what we understand as capitalist democracy. The small ruling feudal class broadened out into a plutocratic governing class, which was still large. The capitalist democracy is a thing that is dying hard. It has been dying since 1940. It is dying still â€“ not quite dead yet.\nâ€œWhen you say that this is the age of the common man â€“ a phrase I think was first used by Henry Wallace in the United States of America â€“ that power is widening out into the hands of the people. I, who believe in democracy, would term it in this way: that capitalistic democracy is widening out into a peopleâ€™s democracy. I am not using the word â€˜democracyâ€™ in a certain totalitarian sense that may be used by certain others. I am using the word â€˜democracyâ€™ in the true sense of the word and the entire emphasis today must be on the needs of the people. That is the position â€“ the international position â€“ of changes that are taking place, and in that context we obtained a large measure of political independence.\nâ€œThe task, therefore, that faced us was two-fold: to convert socially, culturally, economically and administratively a colonial system into a free system and also to do it in a manner calculated to give effect to the second need of changing world conditions when the true needs of the people were attended to as a primary condition.â€\nBandaranaike built his strength on a rural basis. Sinhala as the official language, a special position for Buddhism as the religion of the majority, the delegation of power to village councils and the magic word â€˜socialismâ€™ were the most effective weapons in his armoury. He was the most articulate politician of his time and found little difficulty in getting his message across. He drew into his fold the village school teacher, the ayurvedic (indigenous) medical practitioner and the ambitious and capable young politician who would otherwise have had to be content with a modest post as a Government clerk. The General Election of 1956 proved that his efforts had not been in vain and the successes of the political party he created after he had himself departed from the scene show that he had read the signs correctly and acted shrewdly and with prescience.\nBandaranaike was a master of retort. Once when a Communist leader in the State Council had attacked him and when the same member pretended to be asleep, when it was Bandaranaikeâ€™s turn to counter-attack, he turned to an interrupter and said â€œLet sleeping dogs lie!â€ On another occasion Dr. N. M. Peres the Trotskyite leader, during the Budget debate said that Bandaranaike could not help being merely the â€œfamous son of a famous father.â€ The merciless retort by Bandaranaike alluded to his opponent as the â€œobscure son of a still more obscure father.â€\nSix bullets from an assassinâ€™s weapon laid him low.\n','2024-07-06','Politics','http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SI-P06-07-07-PDC-3.jpg','http://island.lk/s-w-r-d-bandaranaike-1899-1959-laid-low-by-six-bullets-from-an-assassins-weapon/'),(130,'Ships,Â vel palamÂ and other concerns','President Ranil Wickremasinghe got a bellyful of criticism in the print media last Sunday â€“ June 30. Â Why? His Address to the Nation which he named Good News and believed would descend, Cass is certain, like manna on an adoring public; consolation and salvation brought unto them singly and solely by him throughout-negotiating the IMF as he outdid the bankruptcy of the country. True, if bankruptcy is solely measured by queues for gasoline products.\nHe did accept the challenge when the House of the Rajapaksas was in a shambles with the PM Mahinda R, slinking home after being made to shed his premiership; and President Gotabaya fleeing overseas, shorn of his presidency, leaving the country headless. Sajith and his team made unfulfillable demands to steer the country forwards; he was cowardly. Ranil accepted the challenge, working with the Pohottu Cabinet.\nHe succeeded to a large measure in steadying the country but definitely not all by himself and not really satisfactorily. He is widely accused of shielding the corrupt and allowing corruption to continue like receiving commissions and handouts. The culmination of his appeasing greed in others, in his greed to continue as Prez, will be if he permits luxury car licenses to the present MPs and gives in to their demand for insurance for life in addition to the pensions for life, they get from serving just one term in Parliament.\nCass speaks as a householder. Her burdens have increased. Her domestic expenses have not decreased much. The meager interest earned from depositing her stringently saved earnings when she was employed is taxed; having a meal in a restaurant is now an unrealised dream since a heavy tax has to be paid. More people have fallen below the poverty line.\nMalnutrition is on the rise and the education and health sectors are not at all what they should be. Past leaders lived it up and we have to pay; they borrowed heavily and built useless vanity structures and we have to pay. We the poor bear so much of the expenses of the state, which state they crashed. And they live carefree in comfort.\nTo come back to the broadcast to the Nation by the President, his good news was that the country is now on an economic even keel and repayment of taxes is off our shoulders for a long time. We are far from economically all right and repayment of borrowed money has to be done, though temporarily debtor countries have given us grace periods.\nThe analogies, similes, metaphors, comparisons were what took Cassâ€™ goat as the saying goes. She was astounded and then giggled uncontrollably. Ranil equated himself to Grusha of theÂ Caucasian Chalk Circle. Bertolt Brecht had Grusha, the maid in the Governorâ€™s mansion save the deserted Governorâ€™s child and carry it to safety and then when the Governorâ€™s wife claimed the child as hers, Azdak the Judge, very wisely decreed the child belonged to Grusha, who had proved herself a genuine mother.\nAnd so Ranil Wickremasinghe himself decreed that he carried deserted, bereft Sri Lanka to a safe economic state and thus (though unsaid in so many words) should be rewarded with getting Sri Lanka as his: continued protectorÂ alias its next Prez. Quite an analogy included in his Address to the Nation, said before too, and later in his address to Parliament on 02 July.\nAnother analogy cropped up at a recent political meeting of a motley collection of members of different political parties with Harin Fernando leading the bandwagon. He said that Ranil Wicks, wisely, adroitly, most cleverly, and with remarkable seamanship (economic knowhow) steered the ship â€“ Sri Lanka â€“ to safe waters, a haven where all people can now breathe free and be happy, their economic and other burdens lifted. Listening, Cass spat out: What nonsense!\nThen, when it came to the one being lauded and launched (as likely Prez), Ranil made his speech of acceptance of being lauded and launched by upgrading the ship he steered to safety as the Titanic! He was successful in steering it to a safe haven (even if it is to pretend economic recovery) unlike Captain Edward J Smith, who had his Titanic sink to the bottom of the ocean on April 14, 1912.\nYou have to admit that Wickremesinghe did bring sanity into government madness, a kind of stability to the situation in Sri Lanka; got the economy going and influenced the IMF and funders to help the country. But definitely not single-handedly. So many helped.\nRanil W is not safe and settled.Â  He has not in plain Sinhala announced he is contesting the to-be presidential election? Not in English nor Tamil either. However he has been strongly hinting so and Harin Fernando and others who bawled out at the meeting on June 29 indicated definitely it was a launching of candidature event.\nNow Cassandra comes into her own; meaning she is able to make prophetic pronouncements like her Trojan ancestor who shouted â€˜I see bloodâ€™ and soon enough her abductor/patron/keeper, King Agamemnon, was dead â€“ murdered by his queenâ€™s lover. Present day Cassâ€™ warning is to Wickremesinghe. She says: â€œSome of the politicians seen at the Harin Fdo meeting which means they are in your camp are sure too heavy ballast to carry on your ship as you secure it.\nThe ship will sink even in shallow water with such on board.â€ Another warning: â€œRemember Winston Churchill lost the parliamentary election of 1945 soon after the victory of the Allies of which Britain was a partner in WWII. More than your achievement, RW, he was instrumental in winning a world war that raged for five years and Britain was almost invaded by the Nazis.â€ So, beware whom you take on board. You worked with a Cabinet including some dubious characters, or should it be said â€˜mostâ€™? Now donâ€™t have those who are known for thuggery and thieving.\nThe Sea around Sri Lanka\nCass joins in mourning the death of a Navy person who was shot and killed by Indian fishermen illegally fishing in Sri Lankan waters. Priyanka Ratnayake, aged 40 and father of two, lost his life in service. He was said to be a competent swimmer and diver and a man well-spoken of. This focuses very necessary attention on fishersâ€™ poaching, of which thieving act South Indians seem to outdo very much our own. A solution must be negotiated. Easier said than done, but another clichÃ© is apt here: If there is a will, there is a way.\nFour deep sea fishermen have died because of their greed, stupidity and the common factor of anything free is fair fare. Sri Lankans are notoriously known to accept even a headache if free. A bottle floating in the high seas is dragged or fished in and contents consumed. These men surely had to be already inebriated on drink or drugs to swig off a bobbing bottle. Did they not fear it could contain a spirit caught and bottled and flung into the sea as is done by ourÂ kattadiyas?\nLast bit of sea news.Â A seascape of mountains fairly distant from the south of the island but within its territorial waters has attracted commercial attention. Believed to be rich in cobalt it is to be exploited. And who is a forerunner businessman wanting to lay his hands on this treasure â€“ Gautam Shantilal Adani, great friend of PM Modi and exploiter of our land. Cannot we keep the cobalt to ourselves or is it to be sold cheap to fill a couple of rogue pockets, as is usual in this land like no other?','2024-07-04','Politics','http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/cassandracry.jpg','http://island.lk/ships-vel-palam-and-other-concerns/'),(131,'RWâ€™s â€œjudicial cannibalismâ€ stirs up a storm','View from the gallery\nby Saman Indrajith\nThe topics of the judiciary and its independence were a recurring theme during last weekâ€™s parliamentary sittings. Both government and opposition MPs took turns discussing various aspects of the judiciary, with some using their parliamentary privileges to criticize judges and the courts.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe led the baton charge on Tuesday morning, explaining his stance on the recent Supreme Court determination on the constitutionality of the Gender Equality Bill. Using the words â€œjudicial cannibalismâ€, he found fault with the court for holding that the Bill violated the powers of Parliament under Article 4 of the Constitution and called for the appointment of a parliamentary select committee to study and make recommendations on this matter. But he did say he was not proposing summoning judges before the select committee.\nHis choice of words and focus on that judgment attracted both positive and negative reactions within and outside the House as well as in various forums beyond.\nShortly after the presidentâ€™s statement, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran suggested that it would be better to refer the Bill back to the Supreme Court for a re-evaluation rather than challenging its decision. He also expressed concern that appointing a select committee to review a Supreme Court decision could lead to unintended consequences.\nThese two positions formed the main thrust of discussion throughout the weekâ€™s sitting both in and out of the House. Many government and opposition MPs talking to each other in parliamentâ€™s lobbies and corridors were trying to figure out the presidentâ€™s real intention in challenging the countryâ€™s apex court. Some argued that the attempt to appoint a select committee might lead to a clash between the judiciary and the legislature, which was considered the last thing the country needed at this time.\nAfter his speech, the president visited the opposition lobby on the second floor of the Parliaemnt complex and chatted with opposition MPs on the emerging political picture. Maithripala Sirisena was also present and remarked that he was relieved his presidency was limited to five years, allowing him to avoid the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic repercussions. When an MP jokingly suggested that crises during Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s tenure might have been attributed to Sirisena, the president chuckled but made no comment.\nWhen Gampaha District SJB MP Harshana Rajakaruna passed by, the president said he had heard about an incident involving the MP and a woman at the Kotte SJB office. Rajakaruna said the incident took place not at the SJB Kotte office but at the opposition leaderâ€™s office at No 30 Marcus Fernando Mawatha. He described it as a minor incident that was quickly resolved.\nSome opposition MPs complained to the President that senior public servants had been granted duty-free vehicle permits but MPs permits have not yet been issued creating many problems for them. The president seeing Sajith Premadasa passing told them to make that request through the opposition leader and he would then discuss it with government MPs to find a solution.\nâ€œHere goes the opposition leader. Tell him your problems,â€ the president said.\nPremadasa continued to walk away saying that he heard nothing, and his ears were sealed.\nSirisena quipped that silence could be termed as an â€˜yesâ€™ in a court case, and Premadasaâ€™s silence too could be counted as an approval for the opposition MPs request.\nWickremesinghe stayed on in parliament participating in both the government group meeting and the cabinet meeting. By evening, many government MPs correctly anticipated that the comments on the judiciary would dominate discussions throughout the week. Some MPs met with the president and supported his proposal to appoint a select committee, citing instances where they felt the judiciary had hindered parliamentary processes and politics.\nWhen the president met with government MPs, some raised the issue of the Constitutional Council rejecting his proposal to grant a service extension to the current Attorney General. Upon hearing MPs argue that the stance taken by three civil society members of the council was legally wrong, the president nodded but remained silent. A legal officer present noted that the law does not prohibit a president from resubmitting a nomination that had been previously rejected by the council. Sitting beside the president, Ashu Marasinghe asked whether the same nominee would be put forward again for consideration; the President smiled without responding.\nThe following day, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that the phrase â€˜judicial cannibalism,â€™ simply meant the judiciary was encroaching upon the province of the legislature which is responsible for lawmaking. â€œWhen the court attempts to make laws or usurp the duties of the legislature, it creates a crisis because it undermines the doctrine of separation of powers,â€ he said.\nHe didnâ€™t stop there but continued to criticize judges and courts. He said that unethical conduct of a handful of judges has led to erosion of public faith in the judiciary. He cited examples of judges taking bribes, illegally tapping electricity and water lines, stealing whiskey from court record rooms etc etc.\nâ€œThere was an instance where two investigations confirmed that a Magistrate living in a bungalow next to the Mount Lavinia court had tapped both electricity and water supply lines to the court and helped himself to a reduced bill. This was uncovered when another judge complained of this illegal act to the Judicial Service Commission. The Commission sent an electrician to investigate and he nearly got electrocuted. He had to be admitted to the ICU to save his life. People point out that tapping water and electricity supply lines were non-bailable offences and question what action has been taken against the errant judge,â€ the minister said.\nIn opposition circles, some suggested that Minister Rajapakshe was reacting to recent court rulings regarding his bid for the SLFPâ€™s presidential candidacy leading to his criticism of judges. Another MP remarked that the judge in question appeared to be struggling financially, implying that if judges cannot live on their salaries and resort to theft, it reflects poorly on the judiciary. Yet another MP viewed the Justice Ministerâ€™s entire diatribe as a significant condemnation of the countryâ€™s judiciary.\nEarlier on the same day, SLPP dissident MP Dayasiri Jayasekera passionately raised a privilege issue, criticizing courts and judges. He claimed that his privileges were violated due to court orders that prevented him from actively participating in politics. He emphasized the importance of courts maintaining political neutrality.\nOn Thursday, NPP MP Harini Amarasuriya remarked that the Gender Equality Bill was hastily drafted, leading to numerous errors and weak provisions. She criticized the lack of proper discussion in the media and other forums, which would have allowed stakeholders to express their views on the Billâ€™s objectives. She expressed concern that certain provisions in the Bill, instead of protecting vulnerable groups, could worsen the existing situation.\nParticipating in the second reading debate on the Women Empowerment Bill, Dr. Amarasuriya said that the Supreme Court acted appropriately when a draft Bill containing vague and conflicting provisions was referred to it. Therefore, she emphasized that blaming the court for mistakes in Billâ€™s drafting process was unjustified.\nSJB MP Imthiaz Bakeer Markar expressed concerns about attempts to manipulate the judiciary and the processes of the Attorney Generalâ€™s Department. He urged Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena not to allow Parliament to be used for such manipulations and to take steps to uphold its dignity and independence.\nOn Tuesday the House debated five Orders made under the Tourism Act, three Regulations made under the Registration of Title Act, Crown Lands Ordinance and Convention Against Doping in Sports Act. On Wednesday Regulations and an Order under the Casino Business (Regulation) Act, a Resolution under the Coconut Development Act and Regulations under the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act were taken for debate. On Thursday the House passed the Women Empowerment Bill with amendments and the Sri Lanka National Commission for UNESCO Bill.

An unexpected presidential fiat, delivered just a few months before a possible election by a potential presidential candidate, was made public from the political platform of a major plantation trade union, generally seen as pro-government. The self-evident political implications do not merit either debate or elaboration.\nPreamble\nIn a rational world, in any industry, the employer and the employee should arrive at a fair wage through a consultative process. The unsolicited intervention of a third force with an agenda unrelated to the interests of either party, is undesirable from all points of view. Still, there are precedents, when sitting presidents have mandated wage increases in the plantation sector, for patently political reasons, ignoring the possible toxic economic consequences.\nAbrupt and illogically high increases are self-defeating, as sudden, unmanageable cost inflation force enterprises to withhold or diminish essential inputs, deny upgrades, abandon new investment and, in extreme cases, even close down. Unviable enterprises cannot discharge responsibilities to society, stakeholders, the economy and the environment. When operational costs suddenly exceed revenue the only relief is a magical increase in the selling price. Bur miracles do not happen in the real commercial world.\nProducts prices at public auctions are determined by unpredictable local and international market dynamics of supply and demand. Hence, the producer needs to be able to operate within a framework of reasonably priced inputs, especially the workerâ€™s daily wage, which, prior to the above increase, constituted around 65% of the unit production cost; that could well be the largest labour cost component in the unit production cost of any factory produced item, in any industry, anywhere in the world.\nEstimates are that the increase of the plantation wage to Rs 1,700.00 (with EPF/ETF- LKR 1.955.00 per day) will raise the above component to about 75% of the unit cost of production. The balance input proportion, representing fertilizer, energy, chemicals, other material requirements, machinery, vehicle and building maintenance, and welfare and contingencies, offers minimal margin for cost management. With that kind of lop-sided production cost distribution, no legitimate industry can remain viable.\nMarket Realities\nTrade unionists who seek wage increases linked directly to auction price fluctuations, and politicians who support such proposals when it suits personal political aspirations, ignore the realities of international trends of supply and demand. Wage increases, whilst being of crucial importance, especially in periods of rapid cost-of-living inflation, still need to be sustainable in the context of the relevant industry .\nAn analysis of world market prices of Tea and Rubber in the last three decades, will demonstrate a consistent pattern of long troughs relieved by sudden, short-lived peaks. These trends are directly linked to weather, climate, production levels, changes in consumption patterns, resultant supply and demand, exchange rate movements , inflationary or recessive trends in consuming economies, and political climate and state-imposed trade policies and tariffs.\nIn the case of Rubber, in addition to all of the above, speculation in futures markets, crude oil prices, innovations in synthetic alternatives and fluctuating demand in high consumption industries, such as tyre and vehicle manufacture, are key determinants in demand and price. These factors contribute to a permanent state of commodity-market volatility. They also converge to fashion â€œGlobal Economic Healthâ€, which determines the buying and selling price of all internationally traded commodities.\nAll of the above is to demonstrate that, whilst accepting the imperative of a living wage for the plantation worker, that it is unrealistic and imprudent to determine a wage increase, based on industry revenues during periods of peak prices.\nImpact Distribution\nThe mandated increase will impact tea, rubber and oil palm plantations in the RPC sector, private â€œbought leaf factoriesâ€, mostly in the Southern and Sabaragamuwa provinces and, in particular, about 500,000 tea small-holders, again located mostly in the above provinces. The segment delivers 72% of the National Tea Production and 65% of the National Rubber Production, and represents a community of about 1.5 million citizens. That important vote-bank, primarily Sinhala speaking, is concentrated in the South, Sabaragamuwa and in a wide swathe in the mid-country, between Pussellawa and Matale. In a presidential election these people may not vote for the man who, with one irrational and cynical gesture, impoverished them.\nSmallholder Segment\nContrary to popular belief that only a few â€œrich companiesâ€ will be affected by the wage increase, in actual fact, the smallholder will be the biggest loser.\nDue to contribution to total national production, the smallholder is the most important segment in both Tea and Rubber. Individual holdings range from around 50 ha to half-hectare extents or less. This segment relies on external labour for harvesting (and for other work as well), generally on the payment of Rs 40 per kg of green leaf. Consequent to the mandated increase, harvesting one kg of green leaf will cost them around Rs 80, with no possibility of additional revenue. The green leaf is purchased by the manufacturing factory, based on the Tea Commissionerâ€™s formula, linked to the Factory Net Sale Average, which is determined by auction prices. Any revision of the current green payment formula, designed to relieve the supplier, will bankrupt 427 private tea factories which, collectively, manufacture 70% of the national tea production.\nA smallholder, confronted by suddenly increasing input costs and diminished revenues, may respond by harvesting less often, resulting in lower crops and a poor standard of green leaf. That will affect made tea quality, resulting in lower auction prices, a diminished net sale average for the manufacturing factory and, again, a proportionate diminution of the green leaf payment to the smallholder/supplier.\nPoor quality tea coming in to the auction will affect demand, diminish the national net sale average and the competitiveness of Ceylon tea, with a corresponding impact on foreign exchange earnings. Exporters seeking quality Tea are likely to move to Kenya, India, Vietnam or Indonesia, and still buy reasonable quality at one USD per kilos less than in Colombo. The overall outcome will be massive hit on every aspect of the national industry, including value-added exports.\nAlternately, the smallholder may reduce costs by withholding or minimizing inputs such as fertilizer and field cultural practices. Some may either abandon their holdings or convert to other crops. In combination all these will lead to the diminution of national crop outputs which, currently, are at a three-decade low.\nUp to now the most efficient operational model of tea and rubber production was the smallholder segment. The mandated wage increase has thrown that in to total disarray.\nImpact on Rubber Industry\nThe Rubber sector will face a similar fate. Our national production has declined from 152 mn kg in 2012, to 70 mn kg in 2022 ( RRI statistics). With 65% of the production coming from the small holder sector, the wage increase will have an impact as in Tea. The prospect of reduced revenue will inhibit future replanting of rubber, which has a gestation period of six years and a productive life of about 20 years. About 60% of the national rubber production is used locally whilst annual imports are around 60 mn kg a year. The outcome will be a further decline in national production and an increase in imports, if local manufacturers of rubber-based goods are to maintain current production levels. The result will be an increased outflow of foreign exchange.\nKey Economic Factors and Paradoxes\nOf all major tea growing countries, Sri Lanka has the highest cost of production, highest labour cost and the lowest productivity. The new Sri Lankan wage will be about double the Indian labour cost, four times that of Bangladesh, and about 30% more than Kenya, where national average field productivity is about double that of Sri Lanka.\nThis 70% increase will cost the Regional Planation Companies an additional LKR 28 billion a year and with high gearing being a common feature in the sector, will also affect banks and other financial institutions adversely. The total additional annual cost to the industry will be LKR 81 billion. The current auction tea average is LKR 1,250 per kg and, with the new wage increase, the national cost of production will increase to around LKR 1,450 per kg.\nPrior to this increase, the Tea/Rubber wages board minimum determination was the second highest in the country. A demand for a proportionate increase by other local industries would lead to an economic disaster in the country. Another interesting feature is that a plantation worker clocking in for a minimum 25 days per month, working a four-five hour day, will now earn much more than a garment worker who works a minimum of eight hours per day, excluding meal breaks. In fact, both a graduate teacher and a fully qualified nurse, will earn less.\nA common perception is that a higher wage will entice workers to stay on the plantation, rather than migrate to other employment. Nothing could be further from the truth. Since 1992 to-date, the basic daily wage has increased from LKR 66 to LKR 1,700, whilst, during the same period, the actual worker component in the RPC sector, has declined from 32% of the resident population to 17%.\nThe only method by which the plantation worker can be guaranteed a fair income, whilst maintaining the viability of the industry which sustains them, is to move to an output-based payment model. Proposals based on the smallholder model, offered by the RPC sector, guaranteeing the worker up to LKR 2,000/- per day, have been steadfastly resisted by the trade unions as such models would liberate the worker from the clutches of the unions. An independent worker, earning a decent wage and in control of his own destiny, renders the union irrelevant. That is a fearful outcome for politically-aligned unions which rely on monthly worker contributions for their existence.\nConsequences of Political Intervention in Enterprise\nIn this country State intervention in the plantation industry has a dismal history. The nationalization in the 1970â€™s led to the dismantling of a management system of proven efficiency, and its replacement with a state apparatus, which, over the next couple of decades, led to the accumulation of vast liabilities. That, along with other inadequacies, compelled the re-privatization of the sector in 1992.\nIn 2016, then President , Maithripala Sirisena, on the advice of a Buddhist monk, overnight banned the use of Glyphosate, essential for weed control in the plantations. In 2021, then president Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, on the advice of an inner coterie with no experience in plantation management, similarly banned inorganic fertilizer and oil palm. The consequences were disastrous crop declines, freezing of both ongoing and planned investment, massive operational losses in all three sectors and the disruption of the Tea, Rubber and Oil Palm industries, from which they have not recovered yet.\nFor close upon 200 years, the local plantation industry has demonstrated incredible resilience in surviving a series of disasters, some natural and many man-made. This mandated wage, though, may be the last straw. Historians may one day record that the great industry birthed by a Scotsman named James Taylor, was strangled to death by a Sri Lankan named Ranil Wickremesinghe.\nAnura Gunasekera\n(The writer is a retired plantation specialist with over 50 years experience, covering the Agency House era, the State-management interlude and the Regional Plantation Company period.)

The assessment made a few key judgments: â€˜President J. R. Jayewardeneâ€™s United National Party (UNP) government will continue to dominate Sri Lanka until at least 1989.â€™ The results of the October presidential election and the December referendum to extend the life of the current UNP-controlled Parliament for six years were seen as a personal triumph for the healthy 76-year-old President and a strong vote of confidence in his leadership and Western-style, free enterprise economic policies. The fresh mandate provided Jayewardene an opportunity to complete Sri Lankaâ€™s transition to a high-growth, free-market economy with several ambitious development projects aimed at self-sustained growth.\nHowever, the paper (Sri Lanka: Jayewardeneâ€™s approach to Democracy and Free Enterprise declassified by the CIA) further assessed that economic growth brought thorny problems. The government borrowed heavily to pay for development that would not yield dividends for several years. The UNPâ€™s most urgent priority was to curb massive deficits in the national budget, which accounted for an unusually high percentage of gross domestic product. The country faced growing strains in its balance of payments, and overall economic stability was a concern. Jayewardeneâ€™s re-election implied that Sri Lanka would continue playing a moderate and constructive role in world forums, maintaining a pro-Western orientation while seeking to promote investment opportunities. The UNPâ€™s dominance and the weakness of traditional opposition parties enhanced political stability but also risked corruption and indifference within the party ranks.\nCommunal disharmony was the most serious potential threat to Sri Lankan stability. Despite Jayewardeneâ€™s commitment to fostering better relations between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority, powerful UNP members were less conciliatory, and Tamil dissidents were likely to launch sporadic terrorist attacks. This situation was expected to worsen if Tamil agitation for a separate state flared into widespread bloody confrontation. A significant concern was the impact on democratic practices and communal relations once Jayewardene left power, particularly if a less committed democrat inherited the presidency, the paper observed.\nWhat is most interesting is that this paper described the personalities of key political leaders in the country, including JRJâ€™s successor. The CIA paper assessed the succession issue, stating, â€œAlthough we believe that Jayewardene enjoys good health, his advanced age increases the possibility that he will die during his six-year term. Under the 1978 constitution, the Prime Minister, Ranasinghe Premadasa, would become Acting President until parliament chose a successor from among its members. As the undisputed leader of the UNPâ€™s Parliamentary contingent, we believe Premadasa would be the most likely candidate to be chosen to fill out Jayewardeneâ€™s term. In this event, we would expect him to continue the UNPâ€™s free market, development-oriented policies.â€\nâ€œPremadasa, 58, sees himself as Jayewardeneâ€™s heir apparent. Highly popular, capable, and hardworking, he displays a common touch that Jayewardene lacks and has proved himself a major vote-getter for the party. According to Embassy reporting, Jayewardene holds Premadasaâ€™s political skills in high regard, depends on the Prime Minister, and works closely with him.â€\nâ€œIronically, Premadasaâ€™s low-caste origins, which have undoubtedly added to his popular standing, could derail his succession to the presidency. Sri Lanka has been governed since independence predominantly by members of the goigama (cultivator) caste, the highest in status and numerically the largest. Premadasa is the only major political figure on the current scene who is of significantly lower caste, and Embassy reporting indicates that some elements in the UNP are anxious to prevent his succession. We believe recent suggestions that the constitution be amended to provide for an office of vice president reflect an attempt to thwart Premadasaâ€™s candidacy by appointing a suitably high-caste vice president who would then automatically succeed Jayewardene.â€\nâ€œThe UNP has thus far displayed none of the debilitating infighting that has plagued Sri Lankaâ€™s other major parties. Although presidential hopefuls are looking around for support, we see little prospect of any dramatic power plays as long as Jayewardene remains healthy.â€\nHowever, R Premadasa, the man who ruled Sri Lanka after JRJ, showing ample qualities of a statesman, ended his life on the street. He was killed by a suicide bomber identified as Kulaveerasingam Veerakumar (alias â€˜Babuâ€™) of the LTTE, an armed group initially financed and trained by India. Unfortunately, it is questions that torn the political fabric, as the political dynamics resembled a vicious battle. Premadasaâ€™s routine on the day of his death exemplified his dedication. Rising early at 4 am, he began with yoga and perused the newspapers by 5:15 am. Intent on addressing the ruling United National Partyâ€™s rally at Colomboâ€™s Galle Face Green, he instructed his public relations officer to gather facts highlighting his presidencyâ€™s achievements since 1988.\nLater that morning, at 11:30 am, Premadasa inspected the procession he would lead from Sugathadasa Sports Stadium to the rally. Despite security warnings about Tamil Tiger threats, he personally supervised the preparations, engaging with supporters along the route. Tragedy struck when a young man approached, concealing a bomb. The assassin was cleared through the security cordon by his valet, an LTTE plant in his household, and permitted entry to the inner circle. The explosion occurred, killing Premadasa and several others instantly, marking the end of a turbulent era in Sri Lankaâ€™s history.\nPremadasaâ€™s rise from humble beginnings in Keselwatte, a poor neighbourhood in Colombo, to the presidency epitomized his ambition and resilience. Despite his flaws, he remained deeply connected to his roots, yet his presidency was marred by controversies and violence that shaped Sri Lankaâ€™s future trajectory. His death, mourned by some and celebrated by others, closed a chapter in Sri Lankan history defined by both progress and profound challenges.\nHis abbreviated leadership prompted many studies. Josine van der Horstâ€™s book explores the intricate connections between Buddhism and political power during R. Premadasaâ€™s presidency in Sri Lanka. It scrutinizes the aftermath of Premadasaâ€™s assassination, offering insights from informants who discussed the eventâ€™s unusual circumstances and broader implications. Meanwhile, Rajan Hooleâ€™s critical examination in â€œThe Arrogance of Powerâ€ challenges the official narrative attributing Premadasaâ€™s assassination solely to the LTTE. Highlighting discrepancies in the investigation process and allegations of collusion within Premadasaâ€™s security detail, Hoole suggests alternative theories that cast doubt on the LTTEâ€™s singular culpability.\nBradman Weerakoonâ€™s perspective in â€œRendering Unto Caesarâ€ provides a detailed account of the immediate aftermath and subsequent inquiries into Premadasaâ€™s death. Weerakoon, a close associate of Premadasa, acknowledges public perceptions of LTTE involvement but questions the thoroughness of the investigation and the broader political context. He discusses intertwined narratives surrounding Premadasa and Lalith Athulathmudaliâ€™s deaths, noting unresolved political tensions and conspiracy theories that have persisted without a comprehensive independent inquiry.\nWriting a preface to the Premadasa Philosophy, Ranil Wickremasinghe, then the Prime Minister, noted, â€œRanasinghe Premadasa was extraordinary in several senses. He was extraordinary in the magnitude of the social obstacles he faced and triumphed over. He was extraordinary in the extent of the creative constructive work he was able to do, positively changing the everyday life of large numbers of people. He was also extraordinary in the range and richness of his thinking. It is this last aspect which is brought out in sharp relief in this slender anthology of his thoughts. The range, depth, originality, creativity and sharpness of his ideas easily mark him out as a major political, social, and economic thinker, a major conceptual thinker, by any contemporary standard. Here then was the philosopher-politician, the profundity of whose thought is only matched by the sincerity of his compassion for people.â€\nPremadasa was a diligent reader, and he endeavoured to represent developing nations against extortion by wealthy countries. â€œHowever far, however close, or however powerful any nation may be, it has no right to aspire to control another nation,â€ Premadasa said. â€œIt is these same imperatives, sanctity of territorial sovereignty and integrity, which lead the government and the people of Sri Lanka to condemn interference by major powers in the affairs of smaller states. Whether this interference is in Central Asia, Central America, or the Caribbean, it is unjustified. The existence of governments or the assumption of office by governments which are disliked by their neighbours, is no excuse for overt or covert intervention. External invasion, subversion, or destabilization is the theft of decision making from citizens of the nation. We in the Non-Aligned Movement may only be able to resist these intrusions with words. But let the words ring loud and clear â€“ interference is wrong; interference is unprincipled; interference must stop,â€ he said at the 8th Non-Aligned Conference in Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1986.\nPremadasaâ€™s tenure was defined by significant economic reforms aimed at privatizing state enterprises and attracting foreign investment, alongside populist measures to alleviate rural poverty. However, his methods faced criticism for their ruthless suppression of dissent, including crackdowns on the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna rebels and alleged involvement in political assassinations. Despite efforts to engage with Tamil separatists like the LTTE through dialogue and military pressure, suspicions persisted regarding his handling of internal conflicts. His administration also struggled with heightened external interference in Sri Lankaâ€™s affairs, worsening internal crises. Despite these challenges, Premadasa made concerted efforts to uplift the country from poverty and achieve substantial economic transformation. Regrettably, Sri Lanka seems not to have fully absorbed the lessons from its past leadersâ€™ legacies, as political instability and external interference continue to afflict the nation.\n','2024-06-22','Politics',NULL,'http://island.lk/ranasinghe-premadasa-triumphs-and-turmoil/'),(134,'Outstanding sports achievements recognized at Air Force Colours Awards','The Air Force Colour Awards Ceremony 2022-2023 was held on Friday (05 July 2024) at a gala ceremony at the Eagleâ€™s Lakeside Banquet and Convention Hall.

The preparation programme was not carried out as planned. Thus, it became a cracked surface causing too much variation in pace, bounce, and sideways movement,â€ he said.\n\n\nAfghanistan were bowled out for 56 in 11.5 overs, the lowest score in a T20 World Cup last four game, and were beaten by nine wickets with South Africa knocking off the target in less than nine overs. â€œIt was ugly really.

Iâ€™m not saying it should be flat completely with no spin and no seam movement, Iâ€™m saying you shouldnâ€™t have batsmen worrying about going forward.â€\n\n\nKent Crawfton was head curator for West Indies leg of the World Cup [Cricbuzz]\n\nDiscussing the issue further in a Mason and Guest Radio show, he added: â€œThere were a number of cracks. Pre-preparation wasnâ€™t done according to our plan. And it was just a little to dry when the preparation started.â€ He also spoke about the overall preparation of the pitches in the West Indies, saying the weather pattern in the Caribbean this summer was strange.\n\n\nâ€œThere were a number of reasons [for some pitches to go wrong]. First of all, we had a very strange weather pattern in April, even March-April, especially in some of our islands. It was extremely hot and dry. But I must say we all went for that period as strongly as we could in terms of getting our operations done.\n\n\nâ€œAll the venues we put in the work that was needed in terms of rehabilitating our squares and getting them up to scratch. And I think generally we were quite ready. Certain things didnâ€™t work according to plan. Based on what I would see could have been the management of our squares during that long period. I think it was one of our shortcomings.â€\n\n\nCrafton also addressed the issue of some surfaces having grass cover while a pitch like the one at the Kensington Oval in Barbados, which hosted the final, had a brownish look.\n\n\nâ€œThe aim was to have all pitches to be prepared with live grass, and all six venues were fully grassed ahead of detailed pitch presentation,â€ Crawfton said. â€œThe management of the squares during the tournament, especially at the Kensington Oval, where their matches span from June 2 to 29, is the outstanding reason. Excessive covering and not sufficient moisture retained in the pitch block. The green pitches were managed better than the bare ones.â€\n\n\nA part of the 29-day 55-match World Cup was staged in the US with 16 games of the first round played in New York, Dallas and Florida. For the eight games in New York drop-in pitches were used and Crawfton said he did not have much information on those surfaces where batting was difficult.\n\n\nâ€œWell, for sure, itâ€™s very difficult for me to make a pronouncement when I wasnâ€™t there to actually see the end result. But I did see those pictures in Florida when they were under construction. They were fully built and they were grassed when I saw them, and they looked level and they looked good. The only issues we have with pitches is that the grass we use on those pitches has to be thinned and light. Iâ€™m not sure how much that was done. Iâ€™m not sure how thin that grass was,â€ Crawfton said.\n\n\nâ€œAccording to our construction of pitches, the only difference we had with those drop-in pitches was that the grass that was used on those pitches was not the Bermuda grass, which we normally use on your pitches. It was more like that could have been a reason. I cannot pinpoint, as I said, because I donâ€™t have that information. But I know for sure the grass was different. But I donâ€™t think that a drop-in pitch constructed months ahead of the tournaments would have been a failure.â€\n\n[Cricbuzz]','2024-07-08','sports','https://www.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/595x396/i1/c512492/kent-crawfton-was-head-curato.jpg','http://island.lk/pitch-preparation-for-trinidad-semifinal-went-awry-concedes-chief-curator/'),(137,'Two aged US presidents square off in debate for the ages','Democrats panic as President Biden has a dismal night\nby Vijaya Chandrasoma\nThe Biden-Trump debate, touted as the political face-off that would change the course of history, was held Thursday night at the CNN studios in Atlanta, Georgia. The rather unusual ground rules for the debate had been agreed upon by the candidates weeks ago. It was the earliest presidential debate in history, held as it was more than four months before election day in November.\nThese ground rules were considered to be essential to avoid a repetition of the debate between these two when they were candidates for the presidency in 2020. During that first debate nearly four years ago, the general consensus was that Trump was â€œunhinged, bullied, bulldozed and obfuscatedâ€ (CNN), talked â€œincoherently and rattled off unfounded and baseless attacksâ€ (NBC) spewed â€œmisleading claims and outright liesâ€ (New York Times) and showed he had â€œnothing but contempt for the values and norms that are essential to democracyâ€ (Washington Post). No one wanted to see that kind of confrontational fiasco again.\nThe moderators of the debate were CNNâ€™s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. The estimated millions watching from home had a variety of viewing options. CNN started the live broadcast at 9.0 p.m. EST on Thursday June 27, with every major network, domestic and international, providing a simulcast.\nThere was no live studio audience to chime in with cheers and jeers while the candidates were speaking during the 90-minute debate, a distinct disadvantage for Trump, who feeds off the hysterical cheers of the audience as he throws red meat at them during his scandalous speeches, with a lie per minute. Another disadvantage for Trump was that the microphones of each candidate were muted while his rival was speaking, so he was not able to constantly keep interrupting Biden as he did at their first debate in 2020. Interruptions which finally elicited exasperated responses from Biden: â€œWill you shut up, manâ€ and â€œItâ€™s hard to get any word in with this clownâ€.\nTrump won a coin toss to decide which side of the stage he would like his podium placed, and he chose, predictably, the right. Though the podiums were placed probably too close for comfort, just eight feet apart, for two men not overly fond of each other! They were required to remain standing for the duration of the debate, and were not allowed to bring any notes or have any contact with their staff. They were each given blank sheets of paper and pens.\nPresident Biden and Trump prepared for the debate in vastly different ways, which reflected their individual characters and styles. Biden hunkered down with a few of his closest advisors at Camp David, the presidential country retreat in the wooded hills of Catoctin Mountains in Maryland, 100 km. from Washington DC.\nTrump prepared for the debate by speaking to his voters at campaign rallies. Apart from his regular lies about his greatness and the constant whining about being the victim of the biggest witch-hunt in history, he kept harping on how he was expecting a strong performance from President Biden at the debate. This, after nearly four years of calling him â€œSleepy Joeâ€, and an old man who couldnâ€™t string two sentences together. His camp had realized that they may have set such a low bar for Biden that all he had to do to win the debate was to show up and remain conscious and standing for 90 minutes! Which is nearly all he did.\nAfter the stirring speech Biden made at the State of the Union in March, they thought that Biden would make a strong debater. So Trump â€“ and Fox News â€“ spread the lie that he must have been jacked up (high) on performance enhancing drugs for the State of the Union speech. They claimed he would be so energized for this debate also.\nTrump mocked that they (Bidenâ€™s staff) will be making sure â€œheâ€™s sleeping now, because they want to get him good and strong; heâ€™ll get a shot in the ass (perhaps cocaine) during the debate, so heâ€™ll come out all jacked upâ€, the insinuation being that Biden can only perform well with the aid of drugs. Trump was talking about requiring Sleepy Joe take a drug test before the debate, with allegations ridiculous, insulting and unprecedented. Of course, President Biden need not insist that Trump also should take a similar test, because Trump doesnâ€™t need any drugs to act like a crazy, unhinged buffoon.\nAt the beginning of the debate, millions saw a decent, elderly, but noticeably below par President Biden, facing an obese, orange-colored, convicted felon, in debt for hundreds of millions of dollars, desperate to win an election which will save him from a life in prison. Trump exuded false confidence, but he was well aware that his popularity is eroding after his recent convictions. He will face further problems after sentencing on the New York case of 34 felony counts on July 11, and heâ€™s terrified at the prospect of imprisonment. So this debate was a matter of life or death for Trump.\nFormer First Lady Melania Trump was conspicuous by her absence, while First Lady Dr. Jill Green was there to support her husband in this crucial moment in his life, as any normal, devoted wife would.\nThe debate was lost in the first three minutes. Basically, the debate was between the old man against the con man, and the con man won outright. The old man behaved his age, and one couldnâ€™t help but imagine how old and decrepit Biden would be at the end of a second term, when he would be 86-years-old.\nTrump behaved like the con man he is, lied and prevaricated as usual, but he was stable and controlled in his lies. He repeatedly made assertions which were outright falsehoods, but Biden was not able to challenge him. Trump stayed focused and hinged for the full 90 minutes. He was the obvious winner, but when all his lies are brought out into the open, the win will not seem that conclusive. CNN Flash Poll results immediately after the debate had Trump winning the debate 67% to 33%.\nOkay, it was just 90 minutes in the election campaign, even though it was a crucial 90 minutes. There are four months to go till the election. Ninety minutes of failure against all the hard and productive work Biden has done in the last three and a half years and the four months left till the election to redeem himself for one bad night. Resiliency has been Bidenâ€™s enduring quality in five decades of public service. Maybe heâ€™ll recover from his dismal performance in the debate, when voters weigh the progress he has made in the economy, unemployment, etc., which has made the US economy the strongest in the world.\nStill, I donâ€™t think Biden will recover from this debacle. I also donâ€™t think, after the debate, that Biden will be able to function in the toughest job in the world even till the end of his first term, much less for the next four years. When, at the risk of repeating myself, he will be 86-years-old.\nDemocrats are most concerned about Bidenâ€™s performance, and one operative said, â€œitâ€™s hard to argue that Joe Biden should be our nomineeâ€. The time to look for a replacement for Biden had long been overdue, but itâ€™s a matter of extreme priority now. After all, Biden ran for the presidency in 2020 with the sole motive of stopping Trump from winning a second term, which would have destroyed the country, and serving as a one-term president as a bridge to the next generation of Democratic leadership. He has fulfilled both these objectives admirably.\nThe Democratic Party has a wonderful group of extremely capable and experienced leaders who will be able to replace Biden for the 2024 nomination as President. Maybe it is time for Biden to retire gracefully with great honors and hand over the reins of government to the next generation of Democratic leadership.\nA young Democrat to the center of the Party will wipe the floor with convicted felon Donald Trump and his radical Republicans in November, and most importantly, destroy the existential threat that Trump presents to the Great Experiment of Democracy in the U.S.A.','2024-06-29','Politics',NULL,'http://island.lk/two-aged-us-presidents-square-off-in-debate-for-the-ages/'),(138,'War crimes in Gaza: Silence of West and its media','Day after day, Israel commits unspeakable atrocities against Palestinians.

They didnâ€™t get anywhere near close, as Indiaâ€™s vastly superior bowling attack made full use of a two-paced pitch while defending a total that was well above-par. The margin of victory â€“ exactly 100 runs â€“ perfectly summed up the contest.\nOn Saturday, Zimbabwe had opened the bowling with Brian Bennett, deploying his offspin against Indiaâ€™s left-hand debutant, and that had brought a first-over wicket-maiden with Abhishek out for a duck. The same match-up kicked off the second T20I after India opted to bat, and Abhishek got off the mark in international cricket off the first legal ball he faced, pulling it for six.\nIt was a sign of what was to come, but it also wasnâ€™t. International cricket isnâ€™t necessarily a better standard than the IPL, but it can be very, very different. This was a Harare pitch with a bit of spongy bounce and seam early on, and Zimbabweâ€™s attack used it well in the powerplay to keep India to 36 for 1.\nShubman Gill fell in the second over, chipping Blessing Muzarabani straight to mid-on, and the towering quick was Zimbabweâ€™s best bowler in the early stages, troubling Ruturaj Gaikwad in particular with his lift and movement in the corridor. Abhishek took time coming to grips with the conditions too, and at one point was batting on 27 off 23 balls.\nThen he looked to clear his front leg and hit Luke Jongweâ€™s nibbly medium-pace over the top, and miscued it high in the air over the mid-off region. Wellington Masakadza got under it, and put it down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbhishek Sharmaâ€™s savours the feeling of getting to a maiden international ton [Cricinfo]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom that point on, Abhishek was unstoppable, clattering 72 runs in his last 23 balls at the crease, hitting five fours and seven sixes in that time. Suddenly, the conditions ceased to bother him. He was rocking back to marginally short balls and pulling with fierce power. He was stepping out and freeing his arms gloriously to loft over the covers. A modest Zimbabwe attack, suddenly, was looking like what it was.\nThere was another drop along the way, Tendai Chatara running to his right from long-off and getting only the heel of his palm to a lofted drive off Sikandar Raza, when Abhishek was on 77 off 40. Zimbabwe were in the firing line, though, and with all the batting India had in the dugout â€“ they had left out the left-arm quick Khaleel Ahmed and included an extra batter, handing Sai Sudarshan his T20I debut â€“ he was taking nearly every ball on. Abhishek wasnâ€™t worried about getting out â€“ this is why he made such an impact in the IPL even though his longest innings of the season only lasted 28 balls â€“ and on this day luck smiled on him.\nAlong the way, he left a couple of bowlers nursing vivid bruises. Dion Myersâ€™ slow-medium disappeared for 4, 6, 4, 6, 4 in the 11th over, the pick of the hits a monster pull that hit the roof beyond the leg-side boundary to bring up Abhishekâ€™s fifty. Then Masakadza, unfortunate both to have dropped Abhishek and to be a purveyor of left-arm orthodox, went for 6, 6, 6 in the 14th over â€“ the last of them a one-handed swipe over backward square leg that brought up Abhishekâ€™s century â€“ before a miscue off the next ball ended the onslaught.\nGaikwadâ€™s struggle against the conditions and the rust of playing his first competitive cricket since the IPL extended all the way until his 38th ball, when he brought up his fifty with a pulled four off Jongwe. He took Chatara apart in the next over, the 18th, hitting him for three fours and a six to eventually finish unbeaten on 77 off 47.\nIndiaâ€™s main source of end-overs carnage, however, was Rinku Singh, who had been unlucky to miss their World Cup campaign while boasting an average of 89 and a strike rate of 176.23 in 11 innings at the time the squad was announced. He was in his element here, promoted to No. 4 with the perfect entry point for his skills, slapping the sixth ball he faced for a charging six over the covers and finishing the innings with a four and back-to-back sixes off Jongwe, who ended with figures of 0 for 53 in four overs. Not what he may have anticipated when he induced Abhishek to miscue on 27.\nIf Zimbabwe had any hope going into their chase, it lay in the composition of Indiaâ€™s attack. Having picked the extra batter, they were playing only four frontline bowlers, which left four overs to be completed by part-timers Abhishek and Riyan Parag.\nAbhishek isnâ€™t a part-timer in domestic cricket, and has plenty of variations to go with his stock left-arm orthodox, but he discovered how difficult bowling in the powerplay in an international game can be, conceding 19 in the second over with Bennett in an aggressive mood. Bennett took hold of Mukesh Kumar in the next over as well, hitting him for a pair of massive back-to-back sixes â€“ over square leg and then down the ground â€“ but he fell next ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Bennett got Zimbabwe off to a flying start with 26 off 9 before being bowled by Mukesh Kumar [Cricinfo]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was the second wicket Mukesh had taken with an in-ducker, after one in the first over to bowl Innocent Kaia through the gate. That sort of seam movement, with a bit of inconsistent bounce thrown in, was a defining feature of Zimbabweâ€™s powerplay: they scored 22 runs more than India did in that phase, thanks to Bennettâ€™s aggression, but they lost four wickets to Indiaâ€™s one.\nOne of these summed up how challenging the conditions still were: a bouncer from Avesh Khan skidding onto Sikandar Raza as he shaped to hook, forcing him to fend a catch off the glove to the keeper.\nZimbabweâ€™s innings continued to flounder after the powerplay, with Ravi Bishnoi looking particularly unhittable â€“ Johnathan Campbell, sweeping and reverse-sweeping with increasing desperation, failed to put bat on five successive balls from him, and bottom-edged the sixth into his body. Wessly Madhevere batted from the start of the chase all the way to the 17th over, and made 43 off 39 balls. Zimbabwe were eventually bowled out for 134 with eight balls remaining, with Mukesh and Avesh bagging three wickets apiece and Bishnoi finishing with 2 for 11 from his four overs.\nBrief scores:\nIndia 234 for 2 in 20 overs (Abhishek Sharma 100, Ruturaj Gaikwad 77*, Rinku Singh 48*; Blessing Muzarabani 1-30, Wellington Masakadza 1-29) beat Zimbabwe 134 in 18.4 overs (Wessley Madhevere 43, Brian Benett 26, Luke Jongwe 33; Avesh Khan 3-15, Mukesh Kumar 3-37, Ravi Bishnoi 2-11, Washington Sudar 1-28 ) by 100 runs\n[Cricinfo]','2024-07-07','sports','https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_960/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/384400/384469.jpg','http://island.lk/abhishek-strikes-46-ball-ton-as-india-give-zimbabwe-a-thrashing/'),(140,'Ranasinghe Premadasa Birth Centenary â€“ An evergreen leader','By Tisaranee Gunasekera\nâ€œAll theory is greyâ€¦ But forever green is the tree of life. â€œGoethe (Faust)\nFor three months in late 1990â€™s, American author and political activist Barbara Ehrenreich lived the life of a low-wage worker. She wanted to discover, first hand, how President Bill Clintonâ€™s welfare reforms were impacting on the lives of the working poor. Her experiences gave birth to her most celebrated book, Nickle and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America. In it, she focuses on the phenomenon of employed-homeless, workers who often do more than one job but are still unable to afford a roof over their heads. The conjunction of low wages and high rents create poverty traps from which few workers escape, Ehrenreich notes.\nAlmost 20 years later, sociologist Matthew Desmond in his book, Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City, demonstrated the cardinal role played by housing (or the lack of it) in perpetuating and exacerbating poverty in America. â€œFewer and fewer families can afford a roof over their head. This is among the most urgent and pressing issues facing America todayâ€¦ We have failed to fully appreciate how deeply housing is implicated in the creation of poverty.â€\nAccording to Jan-Feb 2024 Household Pulse Survey, homelessness in America increased by 48% since 2015; and an estimated 37% of tenants say they are very or somewhat likely to be evicted in the next two months. The European condition is no better. â€œUnaffordable rent and property prices are turning into a political battleground,â€ The Guardian warned in May. The only exception is Vienna. 60% of Viennese live in subsidised housing. The city builds 6,000-7,000 subsidised housing units each year funded by a 1% tax on all salaries.\nThe Viennese exception is a legacy of Red Vienna (1918-1934 â€“ when the Austrian capital was controlled by the Social Democratic Party) which was defined largely by its housing policy; the city built more than 60,000 new housing units. Sri Lanka, in 1979, embarked on a journey even more ambitious, to build 100,000 houses in three years. When Ranasinghe Premadasa unveiled his inaugural housing programme, it was ridiculed by the Opposition, stonewalled by the UNP cabinet, and criticised by the World Bank and the IMF. The mere thought of building 100,000 housing units in three years, and for the poor, was dismissed as a waste, an inflation-creator, and delusional.\nBut Premadasa would not be stopped. Like other top leaders of the UNP, he was eyeing the presidency and housing was going to be his â€˜qualifierâ€™ for the top job. Those politico-electoral imperatives apart, he understood the nexus between homelessness and politico-social and familial stability. During his tenure as a Colombo Municipal Councillor, he had spearheaded the building of flats in Saunders Place as part of a slum-clearance programme. As the Junior Minister of Housing in the 1965-70 government, he had built the Maligawatte Housing Scheme. As he put it, â€œShelter is not charity. It is a necessity.â€\nBorn and bred in Keselwatte, Sri Lankaâ€™s equivalent of the old Harlem, Premadasa knew well the bitter anger and despair of the marginalised. Homelessness was a time-bomb waiting to explode, he understood, especially in the context of the rapid but unbalanced growth which resulted from the opening up of the economy after 1977. He regarded housing as a major stabiliser, a way of giving the poor a stake in the system.\nIdealism and Realism\nAccording to the UN special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, homelessness is the â€˜social issue of the 21st Centuryâ€™. The seeds of this burgeoning crisis was sown in the final decades of the 20th Century, with the political de-prioritisation of the issue of housing/homelessness. The category of â€˜structural homelessnessâ€™ came into being, an ipso facto justification of political indifference and policy neglect. Shelter was left to the vagaries of individual fortunes and the free play of market forces. Homeless encampments became the norm, eviction a super-profitable business.\nThe Lankan experiment under the leadership of Premadasa in battling homelessness was doubly remarkable because it unfolded against this background of global indifference. And, contrary to the confident predictions of naysayers on the left and the right, the 100,000 Houses Programme worked. â€œThe targets were reached and exceeded by anything between 15%-30% â€“ an unparalleled success in a government Housing Programme in a Third World Country,â€ wrote Prof KM de Silva. (Sri Lanka and the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless). According to a report by the United Nationâ€™s Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, â€œThe programme proved to be a success in terms ofâ€¦target achievement, employment generation through the development of construction industry, and the â€˜benignâ€™ effect in the rental marketâ€ (Low cost shelter project in Sri Lanka â€“ ESCAP). â€œShelter (is) a field in which idealism and realism can blend to the advantage of all,â€ Premadasa had stated in his 1987 speech to the International Union of Architects. His programme, with its broad vision and hard practicality, certainly fitted the bill.\nWhile 100,000 Houses programme was a success in target-achievement, it also revealed the limits of state as house-builder, especially in a rural setting. It was also too costly and too centralised. These lessons were incorporated into the next stage of the Housing adventure â€“ the One Million Houses programme launched in 1984. Unlike the top-down method of the first phase, the second and third phases (1.5Milliion Houses programme) opted for a participatory model, involving beneficiaries at every stage of the process from planning to construction. The stateâ€™s role scaled down to that of assister.\nâ€œWhat we see here is a kind of respect for the poor and their abilities and capacities, or the trust that, if they are given some guidance and resources, they will be able to understand their own needs and respond to their housing needs in a better wayâ€¦â€ Colombo Urban Lab researcher Meghal Perera told a regional seminar on shelter in 2022. â€œFirst of all, the state allowed the people to design their own houses. There are stories of how every single household in this programme was given a file about the loans they could obtain. They were also given a square rule paper for them to design their own houses in the way they wanted. Secondly, there were community building guidelines and rules specific to particular low-income settlementsâ€¦ This programme called for conversations and workshops where women were able to talk about mattersâ€¦â€ (The Morning â€“ 14.10.2022).\nAccording to an island-wide research project carried out by the Premadasa Centre in the mid 1990â€™s, 34.2% of the recipients of the housing programmes were workers, 22.6% were labourers, 18.2% were cultivators, 9.2% were petty traders, 11.8% were self-employed or salaried employees. Low-wage earners who wouldnâ€™t have been able to afford a house of their own, perhaps ever; employed-homeless turned into homeowners.\nâ€œFor the last thirty yearsâ€¦when asking ourselves whether we support a proposal or initiative, we have not asked, is it good or bad?â€ historian Tony Judt wrote. â€œInstead we inquire: Is it efficient? Is it productive? Would it benefit gross domestic product? Will it contribute to growth? This propensity to avoid moral considerations, to restrict ourselves to issues of profit and lossâ€”economic questions in the narrowest senseâ€”is not an instinctive human condition. It is an acquired tasteâ€ (London Review of Books â€“ 17.12.2009).\nRanasinghe Premadasaâ€™s approach to development was conspicuous by the absence of such a purely economistic approach and the conscious incorporation of peoplesâ€™ interests as a primary measure of the desirability or undesirability of an economic policy. For Premadasa poverty was not just an economic problem to alleviate, a matter of numbers and percentages. He could look beyond the figures and see the people because he grew up among them, and continued to live with them even as president. Inside the Sucharitha Complex where he lived, there was even a school for the children of the area. Free of any theoretical bondage or ideological baggage, Premadasa was able to mix-and-match, discarding what didnâ€™t work and bettering what did.\nAs Sirisena Cooray, his political companion and friend of four decades, wrote, â€œMr. Premadasa had his own very different approach to developmental issues; his notion of slum clearance is an example of this. Usually slum clearance means the forcible eviction of the people living in slums to areas outside the city and developing these city locations for commercial purposesâ€¦ This is both a political mistake and a human tragedy. Most of those people would have been living in that area for a long time. They work close by; their children go to nearby schools. If you uproot them from that environment and put them elsewhere they feel alienated; their work, education, and social life get disrupted. What Mr. Premadasa meant by slum clearance was improving the quality of life of slum dwellers by providing them with better housing and other basic facilitiesâ€ (President Premadasa and I: Our Story).\nA necessary aside: Grabbing these commercially valuable land by expelling the residents into the outskirts of the city was a key component of Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s Colombo Metropolitan Corporation plan. â€œThe government is to demolish housing schemes constructed by former President Ranasinghe Premadasa, officials said,â€ (The Sunday Leader â€“ 25.9.2011). The Supreme Courtâ€™s decision against the Sacred Areas Act compelled the abandonment of this plan. But the Rajapaksas were able to nullify another Premadasa initiative: making public sector recruitment mandatory on competitive exams â€“ a recommendation of the Youth Commission of 1989. In 2007, Mahinda Rajapaksa issued a circular restoring recruitment via political patronage. When the JVP objected, Rajapaksa reportedly told them to provide their own lists (Lakbima News â€“ 9.9.2007).\nRadical in conception; conciliatory in implementation\nThere is a global tradition of developmental programmes which are (in the words of Amartya Sen) â€˜good and justâ€™. These are radical in intent but non-confrontational in style and regard economic strategy as a series of compromises balancing the interests of diverse socio-economic groups, for a common good. The Premadasa development projects belong in this category, expansive, yet grounded.\nThe 200 Garment Factories Programme was perhaps the best case in point. It amounted to a radical departure from the national and global norm of herding low-paid workers into specialised zones. Instead, entrepreneurs were encouraged â€“ via loans and garment quotas â€“ to set up factories in places where unemployment and poverty were rife. The state acted not as owner but as facilitator. The factories had to be new constructions, employ a minimum of 500 workers, pay a minimum wage of Rs 2000 plus meals, medical facilities etc. The success of the 200 Garment Factories Programme demonstrated that export-oriented and labour-friendly industrialisation was eminently possibly. An infamously exploitative industry (with sweatshop-type working-conditions) was transformed into its opposite, not through compulsion (let alone expropriation) but through persuasion (incentives). Development miracles are made on earth, via visions uncircumscribed by labels and political will.\nSirisena Cooray writes how in the at the Kataragama Gam Udawa, Premadasa built a common Buddhist-Hindu-Christian-Islamic place of worship symbolic of the ethno-religiously pluralist nature of Sri Lanka. â€œIt was an interesting concept â€“ you would come in together through a single entrance, branch out to go to different places of worship and once again gather together to go out. But the Buddhist monks opposed it; they did not like the ideaâ€ (President Premadasa and I: Our Story). It was another of Premadasaâ€™s dream, a country where primordial differences would not lead to bloody divisions. â€œSri Lanka has always had many ethnic groups, many religions and many social traditionsâ€¦ The history or the future of Sri Lanka does not belong to any group,â€ he said in 1990 and meant it. Lasting unity â€“ be it national or social â€“ could be built only by effecting tangible improvements in the living-conditions of all the poor, Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim.\nGiving everyone something to lose was the only true guarantee against societal violence and systemic instability, Premadasa believed. The rich and the poor, the majority and the minorities, all must be made to understand their need of and vulnerability to each other. In the urban housing schemes Premadasa built, flats were allocated via a pluralist policy. Every apartment block was representative of the larger Lankan nation, with Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim householders. During Black July, Colombo North and Central were spared the worst of violence thanks to this foresight. You could not set fire to your Tamil neighbourâ€™s house without imperilling your own, not in some distant future, but in the next few minutes. Gulfs could be bridged most effectively not by stirring slogans or pious utterings, but by tangible acts: shelter, employment, a leg-up out of poverty. The old Premadasa programme may not be replicable in the new times, but his innovative approach remains timeless; and indispensable.\nÂ \nÂ \nÂ ','2024-06-22','Politics',NULL,'http://island.lk/ranasinghe-premadasa-birth-centenary-an-evergreen-leader/'),(141,'The Future of India-Sri Lanka Economic Relations','By Rumeth Jayasinghe\n\nâ€œBlood is thicker than water. It was natural for India to see what it could do to stand by Sri Lanka at this very difficult timeâ€ â€“ S. Jaishankar\n\nSri Lankaâ€™s relations with India go back a long way. The first inklings of trade consolidated economic, cultural, and religious ties in both countries. In other words, then as now, it is trade that became a bedrock for relations on other fronts.\nGeographical proximity has since enabled these countries to enhance connectivity, as captured in the recent India-Sri Lanka Vision Document, which delves into areas like maritime cooperation, renewable energy, and people-to-people ties.\nIn the 1990s, a series of discussions between the two countries paved the way for a formal trade agreement, the SLFITA or Sri Lanka â€“ India Free Trade Agreement. It was signed in 1998 and came into effect two years later.\nThe agreement went a long way in strengthening economic ties between Colombo and New Delhi. In 2021, overall bilateral trade stood at USD 5.45 billion.\nMore recently, and more crucially, India granted financial assistance of over USD 4 billion and advocated Sri Lankaâ€™s debt restructuring programme by being the first creditor to give financial assurance to the IMF. It was also the first and largest contributor of food, fuel, gas, and medicine, among other necessities, to the beleaguered nation.\nThese have all led to a turnaround in economic ties between the two countries, bolstering prospects for more agreements. Four of these, in particular, stand out.\nETCA (Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement)\nThe Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement or ETCA serves as an addition, one could say sequel, to the current free trade pact between India and Sri Lanka.\nIntroduced in 2015, it proved to be controversial, not just among nationalist parties and professional trade unions but also other groups. Many feared that it would lead to an influx of Indian workers into Sri Lanka, notably the IT industry, at the cost of local labour.\nRegardless of this backlash, the proposal has gained a spotlight in recent months, with discussions resuming in November 2023 after a five-year hiatus.\nThe exact details of the agreement have yet to be disclosed. It is believed to include proposals for expanding trade in goods and trade in services.\nRemoving trade impediments and non-tariff barriers has also been recognised in the proposal. Though there is much ground to cover before reaching a final document, it is widely expected to be signed and ratified within this year.\nLand Connectivity\nThis is one of the more ambitious projects that the two nations have been eying for a long time, though its realisation has been delayed.Earlier this year, Chief of Staff to the President Sagala Ratnayaka began negotiations to translate this into real action. Following a visit to India in March, a mutual agreement was reached on conducting a quarterly review process on connectivity projects.\nThough security concerns have been raised, supporters of connectivity between India and Sri Lanka claim it will bring several benefits for Sri Lanka.\nFirst, they argue it can reduce transportation costs by at least 40%, giving businesses the opportunity to transport goods to India conveniently. The time taken to exchange goods can thus reduce since customs clearance can be processed and finalised quickly.\nThey also argue that construction of a land corridor can benefit the port sector, since inbound containers coming to India can be redirected to Sri Lanka, and Indians will have the opportunity to transport them via roads or railway.\nAccording to their reading, the tourism sector stands to gain enormously in terms of its catchment beyond Colombo to other parts of Sri Lanka, such as the North.Given that India has become one of the biggest tourism markets in Sri Lanka, this can reap dividends in future, though security concerns have swamped optimism on these fronts, and they need to be assessed.\nA land corridor can thus stimulate investments in Sri Lanka, especially the development of Trincomalee as a regional hub can be realised through this initiative.\nEntrepreneurs in the Northern Province can get the opportunity to expand markets beyond Sri Lanka, covering key Indian states such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Again, this needs to be taken with a pinch of salt, given the asymmetry between the two countries.\nDigital Infrastructure Programme\nDigital Connectivity is another area gaining traction between the nations. The Unique Payment Interface (UPI), introduced earlier this year, allows Indians to make payments in Sri Lanka through their smartphones, via LankaQR.\nBoth countries have begun trade settlements using the Indian Rupee, and an effort to create the Sri Lanka â€“ Unique Digital Identity Number is currently underway with an Indian grant of INR 300 crore.\nRenewable Energy Projects\nThe Sri Lankan governmentâ€™s approval of a deal with Adani Green to develop two wind power stations in Mannar and Pooneryn has been received positively and negatively, with critics pointing to the environmental impact and supporters emphasising the immense potential of the Sri Lankan renewable energy market.\nBut Adani isnâ€™t the only Indian company the Sri Lankan government has set its sights on. It has also signed a deal with the Bengaluru-based U Solar Energy Solutions to construct three hybrid renewable energy systems in Nainativu, Analathivu, and Delft.\nImpact on Domestic Policies\nWhatever critics or supporters may say, the growing Indian presence in Sri Lanka indicates one thing: that it wants to deepen economic integration with Sri Lanka.\nIn a recent interview, Indian High Commissioner Santos Jha stated that cooperation will always be driven by Indiaâ€™s goal of uplifting neighbour countries.\nThat reinforces the view that Indiaâ€™s growth trajectory can and will benefit Sri Lanka in the long-term, a view echoed by sections of the Sri Lankan Opposition as well, particularly MPs like Harsha de Silva. Leftwing and nationalist parties have more or less opposed that line, claiming that deeper integration will destroy local industries.\nFor Sri Lanka, economists argue, increased Indian presence in economic and commercial spheres will bring in prosperity and expanded economic activity in the island. Greater integration presents an opportunity to facilitate export diversification. This may or may not have positive spillover effects on employment, particularly in the north and east.\nOn the political front, of course, deepening ties with India will reinforce dependency on one country. That Sri Lanka needs to navigate itself carefully here is a no-brainer.\nA Way Forward?\nRegardless of rhetoric, the potential of Indo-Lanka economic ties has yet to be fully realised. Both countries are working together to create strong bonds and greater linkages.\nFor instance, President Wickremesinghe was one of the first leaders to congratulate Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his securing a third term in office. Modiâ€™s reply to Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored a clear message: Delhiâ€™s desire to foster connectivity in all dimensions between the long-standing allies.\nThe Vision Document developed by Colombo and Delhi underscores the confidence both countries have in these areas. The Sri Lankan government has set a target â€“ 2048 â€“ to become a fully developed country. There is much scepticism about this, but it is one of the proposals that have redefined its ties with India over the last year or so.\nTo be sure, these countries have faced several downturns throughout the history of their partnership. But both need to realise their aspirations. Whether physical connectivity can achieve this is debatable, considering the political fallout it can result in, particularly in Sri Lanka and even more so considering upcoming elections. Yet economic cooperation remains a crucial lynchpin in the future trajectory of Indo-Sri Lanka ties.\nRumeth Jayasinghe is an undergraduate at the University of Peradeniya who is studying management and is interested in economics.

LaLin i De SiLva\nToday (June23) is the 100th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister and President Ranasinghe Premadasa who was born on this day in 1924 at Dias Place, Keselwatte in Colombo Central. He had his primary education at Harvard Methodist Girlâ€™s School and Lorenzâ€™s College and his secondary education at St. Josephâ€™s College, Colombo where he studied up to his Cambridge senior exam. He also received Buddhist instuction at Hewavitarana Daham Pasala in Pitakotuwa (Pettah).\nIt is a pleasure for me to write a few lines on this occasion about a leader who stood by ordinary people through thick and thin. I had the good fortune of meeting him long before he had reached the acme of his career as President Premadasa was a long-time friend of my father, late E.P.De. Silva, who was a well-informed political reporter before he became the Editor of the Daily Mirror.\nPresident Premadasa began his political career in 1950 as a member of Labour Party under A.E. Goonasinha, was elected a member of the Colombo Municipal Council from the San Sebqastian ward. In 1956, he joined the United National Party running unsuccessfully against Dr. NM Perera at Ruwanwella.\nIn March 1960 he was elected as a Member of Parliament from Colombo Central but failed to retain the seat at the election which followed in July the same year. In 1965, he was first appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Local Government, Housing and Construction and the Minister when late Senator M. Tiruchelvam who held the portfolio resigned in 1968. After 1977, when J.R. Jayewardene became the first President of Sri Lanka, Premadasa was appointed Prime Minister. After more than four decades of active politics, in 1988, he became the second Executive President of Sri Lanka up to 1993 when he was assassinated.\nSadly the country lost a dynamic leader who was action and result oriented and had the vision to developing the economy island wide by taking industries to the rural areas and providing employments to rural youth helping to alleviate poverty in the villages. His Janasaviya poverty alleviation and 200 garment factories programs stand out in this regard.\nThe late President had the common touch, always believing in that ordinary people should share the responsibility of finding solutions to their problems. He was convinced that major problems including the lack of foreign exchange could be overcome by harnessing our own resources.\nPresident Premadasa, due to his friendship with my father, never forgot to visit me whenever he visited the Badulla District where I worked as Assistant Superintendent at Downside Estate, Welimada and Superintendent at Shawlands Estate, Lunugala. He was most concerned about the living conditions of the estate workers such as housing, drinking water1}, electricity, sanitation etc.\nDespite the then unsettled domestic situation in the country with twin insurrections in the north and south led by the LTTE and JVP during his tenure, he continued with the implementation of his schemes and programs for economic and social reconstruction. The thrust of his approach was the launching of the village awakening movement Gam Udawa (village reawakening) and Janasaviya (strength of the people). He had feeling for and empathy with the common man and reached out to uplift their living conditions in most of his programs.\nThe object of these, as stated by him, was whatever development the country achieved must benefit the poor and be focused on eliminating the gap between the haves and have nots. He looked for officials with a â€œMust and Can Doâ€ attitude to carry forward his programs. Thereâ€™s a wide perception that had President Premadasaâ€™s life not been prematurely cut down, he would have led the country to a progressive and disciplined future similar to many other developed countries. Such leadership is badly needed today.\nThough sometimes controversial he remains an iconic figure in politics today. Hopefully, present political leaders would learn from his mistakes and follow his good example and pave the way for a better Sri Lanka.\n(The writer is a retired planter and freelance journalist)','2024-06-22','Politics','http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SI-P08-23-06-PDC-2.jpg','http://island.lk/r-premadasa-self-made-politician-and-first-commoner-to-lead-nation/'),(143,'Perera and Hendricks  power Dambulla to first win in LPL 2024','A 154 run opening stand between Kusal Perera [80 off 50] and Reeza Hendricks [54 off 39] helped Dambulla Sixers register their first win in LPL 2024.\nBrief scores:\nColombo Strikers 185/6 in 20 overs [Rahmanullah Gurbaz 36, Angelo Perera 41, Glenn Phillips 52, Chamika Karunaratne 27*; Nuwan Pradeep 2-41, Dushan Hemantha 1-22, Mohammad Nabi 2-20] lost to Dambulla Sixers 188/2 in 17.5 overs [Reeza Hendricks 54, Kusal Perera 80, Mark Chapman 23*; Taskin Ahmed 2-45] by eight wickets ','2024-07-08','sports',NULL,'http://island.lk/perera-and-hendricks-power-dambulla-to-first-win-in-lpl-2024/'),(144,'Seifertâ€™s unbeaten 82 seals win for Galle Marvels','An unbeaten 2 off 49 balls by Tim Seifert helped Galle Marvels defeat Kandy Falcons by six wickets with 17 balls in hand in the 9th match of LPL 2024 played at Dambulla today [07].\nBrief scores:\nKandy Falcons 175/7 in 20 overs [Andre Fletcher 50, Angelo Mathews 25, Wanidu Hasaranga 65*; Dwaine Pretorious 1-40, Isuru Udana 3-30, Zahoor Khan 2-29, Maheesh Theekshana 1-32] lost to Galle Marvels 176/4 in 17.1 overs [Alex Hales 38, Tim Seifert 82*; Shoriful Islam 2-32, Wanidu Hasaranga 1-36, Lakshan Sandakan 1-42] by six wickets','2024-07-07','sports',NULL,'http://island.lk/seiferts-unbeaten-82-seals-win-for-galle-marvels/'),(145,'Arunaâ€™s Olympic qualification ends two decades of wait','by Reemus Fernando\nSprinter Aruna Dharshanaâ€™s qualification for Paris Olympics has ended two decades of wait for a Sri Lankan sprinter in the 400 metres at the worldâ€™s biggest sports event.\nDharshanaâ€™s coach Asanka Rajakaruna\nThe 400 metres is arguably the most productive track and field event for Sri Lanka at the international stage. The 400 metres sprinters have won more international medals for the country than athletes in other disciplines. Yet the country had not witnessed a sprinter run the one lap race at the quadrennial event since Rohan Pradeep Kumara ran at the Athens Olympics in 2004.\nThe World Athletics confirmed Dharshanaâ€™s qualification on Saturday. According to â€˜Road to Paris 24â€™ final ranking published on Sunday, Dharshana was ranked 47 and he became the third Sri Lankan track and field athlete to book the Olympic ticket. Javelin thrower Dilhani Lekamge and Tharushi Karunaratne were the other two athletes to earn their tickets to Paris.\nAccording to the final rankings published by World Athletics on Sunday, Lekamge was ranked 25th while Karunaratne was in the 44th position in the womenâ€™s 800 metres.\nFrom the time he erased the meet record of the 400 metres at the Asian Junior Athletics Championships in Gifu Japan in 2018 the athlete from Seruvila was earmarked for greatness. The athlete trained by Asanka Rajakaruna was looked up to as the sprinter who would one day attack more than a quarter century old national record (44.61 secs) of legendary Sugath Thilakaratne.\nThe direct Olympic qualifying standard was set at 45 seconds and running sub 45 seconds was the target of the former Weera Keppetipola NS, Akuramboda athlete and his coach Rajakaruna when the new season opened in March. However his season opening mark of 45.30 remained his best as he vied for honours under different weather conditions overseas. It also remained Asiaâ€™s best performance this year till mid May. By yesterday only three athletes in Asia, one from Qatar and two from Japan had run faster than Dharshana this year.\nCompeting in Paris will be a huge accomplishment for the athlete hailing from humble backgrounds and that stage will be ideally set for him to try his first sub 45 seconds.\nDharshanaâ€™s qualification effectively ends Yupun Abeykoonâ€™s wait for his second Olympics. With no male athlete confirmed for Olympics until Saturday, sprinter Yupun Abeykoon was Sri Lankaâ€™s nominee for the universality place, though he was yet to prove his fitness.','2024-07-08','sports','http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DI-P12-08-07-TAS-5.jpg','http://island.lk/arunas-olympic-qualification-ends-two-decades-of-wait/'),(146,'Cyclist fined for kissing wife during Tour de France','\nFrench cyclist Julien Bernard has given a light-hearted apology after being fined for kissing his wife during a Tour de France time trial.\nThe Lidl-Trek rider was made to pay 200 Swiss francs ($223; Â£174) by the International Cycling Union (UCI) for stopping briefly during stage seven of the race.\nThe governing body said the fine was for â€œunseemly or inappropriate behaviour during the race and damage to the image of the sportâ€.\nWriting on social media, Bernard apologised to the UCI for â€œhaving damaged the image of sportâ€ but said he was willing to pay the fine â€œevery day and relive this momentâ€.\n\nStage seven of the Tour de France is a short course of 23.3km (14.5 miles) and is one of two time trials in the race â€“ where cyclists race against the clock for the best time.\nThe climb takes place in the famous wine region of Burgundy.

The SVAT system was introduced to simplify the VAT process for exporters and zero-rated supply chain operators.\nIt permitted these businesses to defer VAT payments on their inputs, thereby eliminating the need for extensive refunds. This system has been particularly beneficial in maintaining cash flow and reducing the administrative burden associated with VAT refund claims.\nPresident of the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE), Jayantha Karunaratne said that when businesses pay VAT upfront and wait for refunds, it can tie up a significant amount funds. In contrast, businesses defer VAT payments under the SVAT system, maintaining better liquidity and financial flexibility. Additionally, in the VAT refund system, refunds can be delayed, causing financial strain and uncertainty. Conversely, the SVAT system minimizes the risk of delays by deferring VAT payments rather than requiring refunds.\nHence, SVAT has helped exporters in several ways, exporters can manage their working capital more efficiently by submitting VAT payments, this liquidity is vital for maintaining operations and investing in growth. Further SVAT system reduces the complexity and time involved in filing VAT refund claims.\nThe government had previously announced that the SVAT would be repealed on January 1, next year. However, industry stakeholders including the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) lobbied this matter that Sri Lankaâ€™s exporters would be hit hard if the SVAT system is repealed without a strong value-added tax refund system. exporters would have to pay VAT upfront on their inputs and wait for refunds if there is no SVAT, this could tie up significant amounts of capital in VAT payments, leading to cashflow issues.\nThe efficiency of the VAT refund system has historically been a concern in Sri Lanka. Delays in refunds could make worse cash flow problems and disrupt business operations. Many exporters have expressed their views about the potential withdrawal of SVAT and as the voice of exporters, NCE also urged authorities not to abolish SVAT without a proper VAT refund system. The Cabinet has agreed to postpone the repeal of the simplified value-added tax (SVAT) to April 1, 2025 until a proper VAT refund system is implemented.\nSecretary General/CEO of the NCE, Shiham Marikar said, â€œAs representatives of the exportersâ€™ community, the NCE would like to highlight that we have not received any firm confirmation regarding a proper refund system or the continuation of SVAT after April 2025. If SVAT is withdrawn, exporters will have to revert to the traditional VAT refund system, where they pay VAT upfront and then wait for refunds. Consequently, exporters may still face significant challenges with VAT refunds.\nâ€œMaintaining a favorable environment for exporters is crucial for export-oriented economic growth and international trade relations. Policymakers must engage with industry stakeholders to formulate a solution that addresses the concerns of exporters while achieving the governmentâ€™s fiscal objectives. The Government must consider these factors and seek a balanced approach that supports the continued growth and stability of the export sector,â€ he said.\nThe post NCE concerned over SVAT withdrawal in April 2025 appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-07-06','Business',NULL,'https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/business/27050/nce-concerned-over-svat-withdrawal-in-april-2025/'),(151,'Sri Lanka keen on renewing LRT project- JICA chief','Sri Lanka is keen to restart the stalled Light Rail Transport (LRT) project which was planned from Malambe to Fort, said Chief Representative, Sri Lanka Office of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Tetsuya Yamada at a seminar organised by the Development Policies, Strategies and Development Finance Committee of the Organisation of Professional Associations.\nYamada said that President Ranil Wickremasinghe had requested a re-launch of the LRT project at a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister.\nHe said that they were willing to consider the request positively, but there was a matter of timing, given that Sri Lanka was just emerging from default.\nHe said that they had had discussions with the IMF on borrowing limits to Sri Lanka and had been encouraged to expedite the LRT project, as it would bring more foreign exchange to the Sri Lankan economy.\nYamada said that Sri Lanka must be on guard against â€˜vultures and cherry pickersâ€™ who were seeking to profit from the economic instability in the country.

Having achieved that objective over 15 years ago, Sri Lankaâ€™s Security Forces now find themselves in peacetime, in a world that is somewhat, if not vastly, different from that of 2009.\nOur defence budget is still very high partly because we are having an expanded military and partly because we are still paying back loans and interest for some of the defence purchases made prior to 2009. In this context, there is hardly any doubt that the number of active duty personnel in Sri Lankaâ€™s Tri Forces, especially in the Army, has to be reduced in peacetime. While we refrain from giving exact troop numbers in these columns, it is a fact that countries much bigger than Sri Lanka have smaller armies. It is also worth noting that most countries rely heavily on their reservists if a conflict arises, whilst having only a few thousand active duty or permanent soldiers. This reduces costs vastly in peacetime.\nDefence experts have to arrive at a middle ground to determine the number of personnel that would be adequate to meet the current defence needs. As the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks demonstrated, transnational terrorism poses a real threat to all countries. The quick mobilisation of the Tri-Forces during that horrific incident, perhaps, averted further violence, though the authorities have to investigate the intelligence failures that let it happen in the first place. Just last month, four ISIS terrorists of Sri Lankan origin were arrested in India, which means that the ISIS threat to South Asia still persists.\nQuite apart from these developments, the whole security environment has changed, with factors such as transnational crime, cybercrime, human trafficking and smuggling, drug trafficking, gun-running and sea piracy coming into play. It is vital that we address these issues by deploying the maximum level of resources at our disposal, mainly because Sri Lanka is an island with a huge coastline and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that is 23 times bigger than the countryâ€™s landmass.\nThis is where the importance of intelligence, rather than troop numbers per se, comes into play. Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) has become a vital component of Armies, Navies and Air Forces around the world. ISR is even more crucial for island nations such as Sri Lanka. ISR is defined as the coordinated acquisition, processing, and dissemination of accurate, relevant, and timely information and intelligence to support the Security Forcesâ€™ decision-making process.\nISR systems can collect information from a wide range of sources, including electronic communications, optical, radar, and infrared imaging. Some of the assets used to collect this data include satellites, sensors, drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), aviation systems, specialised ground, sea or space-based equipment, and human intelligence teams. In fact, the latter, also called HUMINT, cannot be dismissed even with the availability of all these technologies.\nThis is why most Security Forces now prioritise ISR over the â€œboots on the groundâ€ approach. Proper intelligence gathering is essential to deal with all of these scenarios and threats. UAVs and drones are even more effective in terms of Surveillance and Reconnaissance because they can remain in the air on a single tank of fuel for over 24 years, looking at the ground or the sea with their all-seeing cameras which are much more sensitive than the human eye.\nThere is still a role for so-called AWACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) aircraft such as the Boeing E-7 Wedgetail, but human operators get tired over several hours and the costs (purchase price, fuel, and payments for personnel) are also much higher for these manned aircraft.\nThe Security Forces in developed countries are also moving towards unmanned ocean vessels including remote-controlled submarines and submersibles or ROVs. While some of the surveillance drones are really expensive at present, prices are dropping and defence manufacturers in the Global South have also jumped on the drone bandwagon, making them much cheaper than the Western equipment.\nIt is also time for Sri Lankaâ€™s Security Forces to focus on Search and Rescue (SAR) in a bigger way, now that defence imperatives have less intensity. They coped admirably with the twin disasters of the MT New Diamond and X-Press Pearl ships on the high seas around Sri Lanka. But they do need newer machines to do a better SAR job. For example, the Sri Lanka Air Force could be in charge of the proposed islandwide Air Ambulance Helicopter service. This will not only make the transport of accident victims (and other medical emergency cases) faster, but also expedite the transport of fresh organs for transplant in case there are deceased young accident victims. This sounds crude on paper, but it is the stark reality â€“ the faster the recipient gets the organ, the greater the chance of recovery.\nIt is important to maintain and uplift the morale of all members of the Tri Forces, while recognising the newly emerging threats and deploying them accordingly. Indeed, the traditional roles of the Tri-Forces are getting blurred, as they all need to be active on land, air and sea to face threats such as drug trafficking. The problems faced by war veterans should also be addressed, lest they fall into the hands of recruiters for foreign wars, as witnessed recently. At the end of the day, any changes to the Tri Forces should not be considered on the cost factor alone, and all operational dynamics and new security scenarios must be assessed beforehand.\nThe post New securityÂ challenges appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-06-22','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/23/editorial/26218/new-security-challenges/'),(155,'Resolve issues stifling tourism','The revival of the tourism industry, hit by the double whammy of the Easter Sunday attacks and the Covid-19 pandemic, was one of the key factors that helped Sri Lanka to emerge from bankruptcy in a short period.

One is that this is generally the off-season for tourism in this part of the world and the other is the confusion surrounding Sri Lankaâ€™s visa policy after VFS was brought in as a technology services provider and facilitator. At one point, all visitors had to pay US$ 101 to enter Sri Lanka. After the uproar this created, the rate was revised to US$ 50 (with VFS fees included) for all visitors, except those from SAARC countries, who paid considerably less.\nBefore the VFS saga erupted, Sri Lanka was set to introduce free Visas on Arrival (VOA) for around 67 countries, a considerable expansion from the seven countries that enjoyed that facility (India, Thailand, Russia, China, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia) apart from Singapore, the Maldives and Seychelles that anyway had visa-free status as a result of visa reciprocity agreements. The controversy surrounding the VFS entry derailed this program, much to the detriment of Sri Lankaâ€™s tourism industry.\nNow that this proposal is to be presented to the Cabinet again, no time should be lost. The visa-free regime for 67 countries (nearly 75 with unilateral and bilateral exceptions) should be implemented as soon as possible. Tourists might still have to pay around US$ 10 to the visa system facilitator, but that is much more reasonable than US$ 50 upfront.\nIt has been proven time and again that visa-free arrangements encourage tourists to travel to such countries. A Sri Lankan, if given a choice between Singapore and the Philippines, would naturally opt for the former because it does not require a visa. The bottom line is, no one likes filling visa forms and red tape. Countries should open their borders to everyone, not closing them like fortresses.\nIn fact, while Sri Lanka was debating the VFS issue, several countries in Asia and Africa â€“ which are all competitors for tourist dollars â€“ threw their doors wide open, to Sri Lankans as well. Thailand recently expanded its visa-free entry facility to 93 nations including Sri Lanka. While Sri Lanka is faltering in its efforts to attract 2.3 million tourists this year, Thailand through this measure aims to attract a staggering 40 million tourists. Malaysia, Vietnam, Kenya, Rwanda and Cambodia too have introduced e-visas for all nationalities. Burundi, Comoros Islands, Djibouti, Guinea-Bissau, Maldives, Micronesia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Samoa, Seychelles, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu offer visa-free access to all 198 passports of the world.\nSri Lanka must also look for reciprocity when deciding on the 67 nations (and more) for visa-free access. It is too much to expect a country such as Germany to grant visa-free access to developing countries due to justified fears of stayovers, but there are some developing countries that still need paper visas from Sri Lankans. For example, rather surprisingly, citizens of Eritrea and Niger (and 155 other countries) can visit the Philippines visa free, but Sri Lankans have to fill complicated forms and show finances and get a paper visa to visit it. Similarly, visa-free access for Sri Lankans to Thailand, a Buddhist-majority country with links running into centuries, was not available until recently.\nIt is, therefore, appropriate that Foreign Ministry officials are also involved to negotiate visa reciprocity where possible. Sri Lankans still need advance paper visas for around 145 countries and the Foreign Ministry should begin negotiations to gain visa-free or e-visa access to at least 25 of these countries within the next decade. They have got visa-free access for diplomatic and official passports for many more countries, but real people-to-people contact happens when the ordinary people are free to travel and explore other countries and cultures. Ordinary passport holders should not be forgotten in visa negotiations.\nIf the present rates of tourist arrivals continue, Sri Lanka will need more inbound airline seats. There are several positive developments in this regard. SriLankan Airlines plans to induct or lease at least three more aircraft to meet the present demand and expand into new routes in South Asia and the Middle East.\nSome airlines, such as Cathay Pacific and Thai Airways, which halted operations at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, have returned to Colombo. Chongqing Airlines, an airline based in Chongqing, China, resumed direct nonstop flights from Chongqing to Colombo last week. Sri Lankaâ€™s aviation and tourism officials should encourage all operators to increase the number of flights and airlines such as Air France, Qantas, JAL, ANA, Virgin Atlantic, BA, Korean, Biman and Akasa to launch direct flights to Colombo. They should attend global â€œroute shopsâ€ where airline representatives look for lucrative new routes.\nSri Lanka is not the only grain of sand on the tourist beach. If our visa becomes too expensive or too time-consuming, tourists will head elsewhere. On the other hand, if it is streamlined and affordable, more tourists will click their mouse and choose Sri Lanka as the next holiday destination. Once they experience Sri Lanka, they will surely come back for more.\nThe post Resolve issues stifling tourism appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-07-06','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/editorial/27336/resolve-issues-stifling-tourism/'),(156,'Koo â€“ shutting down','Indian social media app Koo, once seen as a strong competitor to X (formerly Twitter), is shutting down operations.\nThe announcement was made by founder Aprameya Radhakrishna in a LinkedIn post, bringing an end to the ambitious venture that aimed to carve out a space in the global social media landscape.\nAmong the potential deals were discussions with DailyHunt, a prominent content aggregator.

Thus all restrictions on vehicle imports will cease next year, after a lapse of five years. Restrictions were placed on all vehicle imports (except for diplomatic vehicles and ambulances/firefighting vehicles) with the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, which was followed by an economic crisis in 2022 stemming from the pandemic and other factors.\nWith the recent disbursement of the third tranche under the IMFâ€™s Extended Fund facility (EFF), the economy has achieved stability to a great extent. Foreign reserves have also exceeded US$ 5 billion, which is essential given that vehicle imports generally use up around US$ 1.5 billion per year. With the economy returning almost to pre-pandemic levels, Sri Lanka eased restrictions on all other categories of goods including certain luxury goods. The import of certain other goods also reaches US$ 1.5 billion per year, so it is not fair to blame vehicle imports alone for any downfall in foreign reserves. However, with an uptick in tourism and expatriate remittances, the country is now in a position to recover any foreign exchange outflow vis-Ã -vis vehicle imports.\nThe Government has already partially relaxed restrictions on buses, trucks, earthmoving vehicles and farm vehicles, with more than 3,000 registrations of trucks alone in a few months. It is essential to remove all restrictions on the import of commercial vehicles, because they literally keep the economy moving. The Government recently introduced a new scheme to allow the import of 1,000 vehicles especially for tourism, a move that should ease the transport woes of tourists. The present fleet of tourist vehicles is showing signs of wear and tear, making journeys uncomfortable for tourists.\nThe Government has also allowed the import of electric vehicles (sometimes called New Energy Vehicles) for expatriates in spite of the overall ban on vehicle imports. This has been a silver lining amidst the import ban, as the latest electric vehicles can now be seen on Colomboâ€™s roads. Once passenger car imports resume, the Government should prioritise electric cars and hybrid cars, possibly with the granting of duty concessions and other incentives. Incentives should also be granted for the setting up of DC superchargers and other types of fast chargers. It would be futile to import more electric cars without a good network of chargers countrywide. The authorities also have to take into consideration other factors such as electric battery disposal.\nIt was also reported that three-wheeler imports would also be given the go-ahead from this year or next year. This is best avoided, as the number of three-wheelers in the country already exceeds 1.2 million and there is hardly any room for any more of them. Besides, three wheelers are a menace to other road users, being the primary cause of most fatal accidents apart from private buses. However, the authorities may permit the local assembly of electric three wheelers and also the conversion of fossil fuel-powered three wheelers to electric power. Instead, the import and assembly of quadricycles, which have the advantage of a fourth wheel, should be encouraged. It is also advisable to phase out three wheelers from at least the major cities by 2035, which is incidentally the year that Sri Lanka hopes to end registration of fossil fuel vehicles.\nThis brings us to the paramount need to phase out the import and local assembly of fossil fuel vehicles by 2035, if we are meet the Net Zero targets by 2050. For a start, the Government should first permit petrol cars with 1.0 litre engines. A limit of 2.5 litre engine capacity should be imposed for pure petrol cars and it is better not to allow the import of diesel passenger vehicles, except for buses, vans, pickups and trucks. These limits can be waived for hybrid cars. Many luxury cars are also available in these engine ranges, so this measure would not necessarily lock out luxury car buyers.\nIt is also time to end all permit schemes and instead formulate a more rational duty structure which enables more people to buy cars if they wish to. Permit schemes distort market dynamics, giving an advantage to the permit holders and those who buy the permits, sometimes for astronomical sums. Moreover, it is absurd that ordinary buyers have to pay around 300 percent tax on a car, while our peopleâ€™s representatives get them duty and tax free, with a laughable Rs.1,750 port clearance fee.\nAs long as our public transport system remains inadequate, people will aspire to buy a vehicle. If there is a clean, comfortable, punctual and efficient public transport system, people will either leave their cars at home or not buy them at all. That is what we should aim to achieve in the long term.\nThe post A positive step appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-06-15','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/16/editorial/25593/a-positive-step/'),(160,'EPE introduces sustainable power solutions to Sri Lanka','Eximius Power & Energy (EPE), a Sri Lankan energy solutions company, is introducing the latest and technologically advanced power solutions to the local market.\nPartnering with the Sineng Group in China, EPE brings state-of-the-art power electronics products and solutions.\nChairman / Managing Director, EPE, Danuke Weerasinghe said, â€œSineng Electric, being a Tier 1 Solar PV Inverter Manufacturer, is renowned for its advanced technology, high-quality products, and comprehensive after-sales service.

As this is a leap year, by July 2, 183 days of 2024 have already been added to the history books while there are exactly 183 days to go before 2025 dawns. A special session of Parliament has been called on such an important day.\nA country that was on the verge of collapse two years ago, now leads a mostly comfortable existence. That did not happen automatically. Economic growth does not take place in a vacuum. It does not happen through mere talk. There are strategies and methods that make it happen. Many countries have gone through this painful process.\nA post-mortem does not result in the resurrection of the dead body, but post-mortems are carried out nonetheless. Likewise, similar post-mortems can be conducted about the countryâ€™s economic downfall. But this does not necessarily rectify past economic sins. Many experts prefer to call it â€œeconomic mismanagementâ€. However, such reviews can be used to put the economy on the correct track.\nSri Lanka revelled in debt. The printing of money with gay abandon was another dubious pillar of the economy. This combination, though never a recommended economic management strategy, was used by all Governments to keep the electorate happy. When welfare measures reached up to the neck, they fell into the â€œdebtâ€ category. Berating the 225 Members of Parliament till the end of the world will not resolve these problems. The public, 22 million of them, are not entirely innocent in this economic debacle, as they have been used to get many things from food to fuel at subsidised rates, with barely any concern for the countryâ€™s economy. Nevertheless, the major portion of the blame should go to the ruling class. Deficiencies in debt management and servicing, excessive welfare measures, populist decisions aimed at electoral victories and even the Covid-19 pandemic compounded to adversely affect the countryâ€™s fragile economy.\nFormer President Gotabaya Rajapaksa resigned midway, since all these factors converged and exploded at a single point of time during his tenure. That was a moment of anarchy. It was an extremely dangerous moment in the history of the country. Some even conspired to burn Parliament. Many who were offered an opportunity to take over the reins of the country at this decisive juncture made various excuses and disappeared from the scene. They possibly thought, with some justification, that it would be the end of their political careers. Taking on the post of Premier at that time was deemed that dangerous.\nBut Ranil Wickremesinghe, then the sole Member of Parliament (MP) from the United National Party (UNP), readily accepted the challenge and took oaths as the Prime Minister, despite knowing the extent of the Herculean task that lay before him. He told the cold, hard truth to the people â€“ that economic recovery will not be a walk in the park. He initiated crucial, even painful reforms, to stabilise the economy. Once he ascended to the Presidency, he did not deviate from these difficult but essential reforms, beginning with negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Having restructured domestic debt, he took on the arduous task of foreign debt restructuring, a deal for which has now been reached with the Official Creditor Committee and China. Such deals are not reached on the basis of personal connections, but rather on the basis of the reform program undertaken during the past two years.\nThere is no room for experiments at this stage. The IMF is renowned as the worldâ€™s lender of last resort. If a country cannot economically recover even with IMF help, it can become a â€œFailed Stateâ€. However, that danger no longer exists as the country has reached a decisive threshold in its journey towards economic freedom. This is a great achievement, considering the precarious situation the country was in just two years ago.\nIt is in this context that Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena made a special request from Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to convene a Special Session of Parliament to discuss the countryâ€™s next steps on July 2, in the middle of the year. The countryâ€™s future direction will be decided on at this session and also by the people at subsequent elections.\nAccording to the â€œgood newsâ€ the nation received on Wednesday from the Presidential lectern, the country has a grace period until 2043 to pay back the loans. This will also lead to a reduction in loan interest rates. Sri Lanka has successfully concluded two of the steps in the debt restructuring process â€“ domestic and bilateral â€“ while International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) are yet to be restructured. Sri Lankan officials are optimistic that this will also go ahead smoothly.\nThe forward march of the country from that point onwards will depend on the deliberations and decisions of Parliament and thereafter, of the people in Presidential and General Elections which are slated to be held in the near future. The people must make a wise choice at these elections, without squandering the economic gains made so far. They must think of the future generations, who should inherit a country free from debt.\nThe post A decisive day appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-06-29','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/30/editorial/26694/a-decisive-day/'),(163,'A new era for India','History will be made today when Narendra Modi takes oaths for the third time as the Prime Minister of India. This is incidentally the first time that a non-Congress leader has accomplished this feat in the worldâ€™s largest democracy.\nThe guest list for the ceremony also reflects Prime Ministerâ€™s Modiâ€™s â€œNeighbourhood Firstâ€ policy, with leaders of mostly Indian Ocean Region (IOR) countries invited to grace the occasion. Among them are President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Nepalese Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal â€˜Prachandaâ€™, Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay, Prime Minister of Mauritius Pravind Jugnauth and President of Seychelles Wavel Ramkalawan. Muizzu stands out from this list, as he is widely seen to be pro-China, having ordered the immediate departure of Indian military personnel stationed on the islands. This could signal a rapprochement between the two nations.\nPakistan seems to be the sole major absentee from South Asia, though it will be in the best interests of both countries if they work things out and make peace. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has been deadlocked for almost a decade due to bilateral issues between the two nuclear-armed nations. India has instead turned to BIMSTEC, of which Pakistan is not a member, to secure its interests in the IOR under the Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) policy.\nBut Prime Minister Modi, during his third term, should make a genuine effort to reach out to Pakistan and resolve the vexed bilateral issues. The strained relationship between the two South Asian giants, which has also spilled over into regional geopolitics, has affected South Asia as a whole on the world over. If these issues are resolved, SAARC has the potential to become another Schengen-style zone, with the free movement of people and goods sans borders within South Asia.\nWhatever his detractors might say, one has to acknowledge that Modi has turned India into a regional economic, defence and political superpower, if not a global one, despite the woes stemming from Covid.\nIndia boomed during Prime Minister Modiâ€™s first two terms, leapfrogging the United Kingdom (UK) to become the worldâ€™s fifth biggest economy and growing by 8.2 percent in the last fiscal year. His â€œMake In Indiaâ€ campaign has largely been a success, with Apple considering moving most of its production to India from China and Tata-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) starting to make its iconic Range Rovers for the first time outside Solihull, UK.\nElectric car giant Tesla has seemingly backed out of India at the last minute, but others are sure to fill in the gap. Modi also took a bold decision to privatise the ailing Air India, which is now controlled by Tata. A resurgent Air India recently placed a massive 500-plane order to match a similar order placed by the private carrier IndiGo.\nEconomy or defence, India under Modi will be mindful of one crucial factor â€“ China. The giant neighbour is a double-edged sword, as it is Indiaâ€™s biggest trading partner on the one hand (incidentally, both countries are members of BRICS) and a fierce competitor in every other sector on the other.\nIn this context, it is not difficult to guess why India under Premier Modi has got closer to the Western bloc through military blocs such as the Quad (Australia, India, Japan and UK) primarily to counter the increasing Chinese presence in the IOR. India has also been wary of Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), under which massive infrastructure projects are completed in Asian and African countries.\nHowever, Prime Minister Modi has carefully calibrated his response to world events without necessarily toeing the Western line. For example, India has remained neutral on the Ukraine issue, perhaps mindful of its robust economic and trade relationship with Russia. In fact, both Russia and India are working together for de-dollarisation, whereby Global South countries will be able to trade in Indian Rupees, Russian Roubles and so on. On the issue of Palestine and the Gaza War, India has always stood for the rights of Palestinians, regardless of the Government in power and it was no different under Premier Modi.\nDespite the Bharatiya Janata Partyâ€™s (BJP) rhetoric on the Kachchathivu Island, (an issue which has anyway not resonated with the voters of Tamil Nadu, where the BJP fared poorly), Premier Modi is known to have a soft corner for Sri Lanka and also for Buddhism. India was the first country to offer vaccines to Sri Lanka to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and two years later, when the economic crisis hit the island nation, extended almost US$ 4 billion in assistance which literally helped it to stay afloat.\nThe India-Sri Lanka relationship has gone from strength to strength under Premier Modi, with the signing of a comprehensive connectivity agreement covering fields such as transport, Renewable Energy, ports, petroleum, trade and education. Feasibility studies on the proposed land bridge linking the two countries are due to be started soon. This will be a huge opportunity for both countries to increase their bilateral trade volumes, as road freight is much cheaper than sea or air freight.\nPremier Modi faces the difficult challenge of uniting India, fractured by ethnic and religious strife in recent times. Fortunately, the 2024 election results showed that voters are not easily swayed by communal or religious rhetoric. This is a good sign that bodes well for the future of India.\nThe post A new era for India appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-06-08','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/09/editorial/25063/a-new-era-for-india/'),(164,'Facing future pandemics','Apart from taking more than seven million precious lives, the Covid-19 pandemic brought one other fact to the fore â€“ the inequality between developed and developing worlds. The Global South watched with horror and dismay as the First World ordered and hoarded almost all the vaccines as soon as they came out of the production lines back in 2021, ignoring appeals by the World Health Organization (WHO) and GAVI, the vaccine alliance.\nThe same story unfolded with Covid-19 treatments such as Paxlovid, which were exclusively ordered by developed nations. Western pharmaceutical companies also held on tightly to their patents for vaccines and treatments, without transferring that technology to vaccine manufacturers based in developing countries. In fact, the pandemic has come and gone, but some African countries are yet to receive any vaccines.\nThis was, of course, just one lesson that the world learned from the Covid-19 pandemic. The plain truth is that the world was not prepared to face a pandemic of that scale, despite having faced a few scares such as Ebola, SARS and bird flu. The debate on the origins of the virus still goes on. Coordination on pandemic relief was minimal. We are still learning about the effects of Long Covid, where the symptoms of the disease linger on in the body long after the virus has left.\nAlthough a span of 100 years separated the Spanish Flu and Covid-19, much the same methods were used to control the latter â€“ lockdowns, social distancing, hand washing and wearing masks. This means that viruses still have the upper hand, in spite of major advances in health and medical science.\nBut now, there is a growing perception that the next pandemic â€“ dubbed â€œDisease Xâ€ could be many times more deadly than Covid. In the extreme, it could even be an Extinction Level Event (ELE) with much of humanity wiped out. The best answer is vigilance and research on a global scale, avoiding the many pitfalls that made Covid-19 worse than it actually was.\nAway from the glare of publicity, this is exactly what is happening. For more than two years, countries have worked together towards one historic goal â€“ to ensure the world is better prepared for the next pandemic by learning lessons from the devastation caused by Covid-19.\nAt a time when conflicts, politics and economics have wrought destruction, discord and division, Governments have found a way to work collaboratively to forge a new global agreement to protect the world from inevitable future pandemics. Indeed, the next pandemic is a question of â€œwhenâ€ not â€œifâ€. This effort, driven by hundreds of negotiators from 195 nations, was launched just as Covid was receding.\nAt the core of this effort is the principle that the world must never again be left so vulnerable to another pandemic. Governments must never again fail to cooperate in sharing vital information, medical equipment and medicines. Never again can the worldâ€™s poorest countries and communities be left at the end of the queue when it comes to access to life-saving tools like vaccines.\nThe Member States of the WHO will thus undertake two landmark, parallel efforts: to start negotiating a first-ever Pandemic Agreement (PA) to prevent, prepare for and respond to pandemics, while making targeted amendments to the existing International Health Regulations (IHR). The outcomes of these vital negotiations are scheduled to be considered at the 77th World Health Assembly (WHA) that will open in Geneva tomorrow (27).\nThe PA will ensure real-time access to the capacities needed to protect health workers and communities from a pandemic threat, so that the world will not again experience a repeat of the inequities in access to vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics, ventilators, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Rapid Antigen (RA) tests, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other vital tools. The PA should also have provisions for the rich countries to supply advanced equipment such as Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machines to their poorer cousins. Sri Lanka, for example, has just two of these rather expensive life-saving machines.\nThe PA will also ensure that there are no weak links in the chain of defence against pathogens with pandemic potential. This requires collaboration between countries to share what is needed, including pathogen studies, diagnostics, real-time information and medical resources such as genetic sequencing machines. More studies are needed on Zoonotic diseases, whereby viruses jump from animal species to humans. This is how Covid-19 is believed to have originated.\nThe PA should also make it mandatory for Western pharmaceutical companies to share their technology or patents with vaccine and drug manufacturers in the Global South, such as the Serum Institute of India (SII), the worldâ€™s largest vaccine maker by volume. Better still, they can make the vaccine formulas open-source, so that companies in the Global South can make the vaccines without paying huge royalties or licensing fees to Western companies.\nGuidelines on avoiding the spread of misinformation and fake news through social media and even the mainstream media are also vital in the battle against pandemics. At least a million Covid-19 deaths could have been avoided if these patients did not fall prey to misinformation (called an infodemic) on vaccines, treatments and masks.\nThe mask mandate became a political issue in many countries, leading to many avoidable deaths. It is thus vital to keep the public informed with the correct facts every step of the way during a pandemic. That could mean the difference between life and death when Disease X eventually strikes.\nThe post Facing future pandemics appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-05-25','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/05/26/editorial/23975/facing-future-pandemics/'),(165,'A tipping point for Renewable Energy','Sri Lanka, located in the equatorial belt, is blessed with an abundance of sun and wind. It is, therefore, somewhat surprising that we are still lagging behind in the Renewable Energy (RE) race. However, other countries, both developed and developing, have raced far ahead. In fact, some countries can already generate 100 percent of their power demand from RE alone for short periods. Soon, they will be able to do so 24/7.\nWe are penning these words in the context of the latest reports that RE will this year shrink fossil fuelsâ€™ reigning share of the global electricity market for the first time. That is the key finding of Ember, a leading energy think tank based in London, which on Wednesday published its first comprehensive Global Electricity Review (GER) analysing data from 215 countries including Sri Lanka.\nThe report disclosed that thanks to the galloping pace of new Solar and Wind capacity, RE has been claiming almost all growth in electricity demand for five years, leaving fossil fuels stagnant. But this year, said Ember, they will also roll back fossil fuelsâ€™ market share by 2 percent â€“ the beginning of a decade-long process of knocking them out of electricity production altogether in three dozen developed economies. Two percent may not sound like much, but given the vast extent of the fossil fuel industry, it is a creditable achievement.\nRenewables expanded by an average of 3.5 percent a year during the past decade, compared with an annual 1.5 percent in the previous decade, as prices for Photo Voltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines dropped and their productivity or efficiency soared. Ember found that the world already produced a record 30 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources last year.\nIn addition to the full-year effect of newly installed capacity, Ember says that a 50 percent collapse of solar panel prices in the final months of 2023 will also lead to record new installations around the world. As a result, RE generation this year will add a mammoth 1,221 terawatt hours of electricity supply, compared with 513 TWh added last year. That means trouble for coal-fired power stations, but it could also spell danger for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). As more countries encourage Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales, retail fossil fuel sales will also experience a decline, albeit a slight one as around 95 percent of vehicles around the world still run on petrol and diesel. But this could change within the next 10 years as BEVs gradually gain mass acceptance.\nBut one country in particular has driven the massive change in RE and BEV growth â€“ China. Last year alone, it installed half the worldâ€™s solar panels and 60 percent of the wind turbines, easily rating as the Green Energy transition leader. It manufactures as much as 85 percent of the solar panels the rest of the world installs.\nChina has also become a leader in the electrification of transport and heating, two of the most polluting sectors of the economy after electricity production. Chinaâ€™s BYD has overtaken Tesla in terms of the number of BEVs sold worldwide. Last year it put more electric vehicles on the road and heat pumps into homes than the rest of the world combined, and was responsible for almost all new electricity demand.\nOf course, the BEV revolution wonâ€™t work if the electricity for the chargers is generated by fossil or thermal fuels. Then BEVs will still be burning fossil fuel in reality, even if they nominally run on battery power. Instead, the installation of solar-based chargers (and also ultra-expensive DC superchargers) should be encouraged wherever possible.\nSri Lankan authorities, who are most likely to permit the import of mostly BEVs from next year, must bear this in mind. Chargers depending on RE technologies will actually make BEV-based transport carbon neutral. When approving the entry of several foreign players to the local retrial fuel market, the authorities should have insisted upon having at least one electric car charger at each new filling station, with retrofitting an option for existing ones.\nSri Lanka has set its sights on generating 70 percent of the projected power demand from RE sources by 2030. Just as the deal reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will have to be honoured more or less by any incoming Government, the same policy should apply to RE. All political parties must thus be committed to grant concessions and incentives to encourage the switch to RE and BEVs.\nOne cannot also forget that the fossil fuel industry is trying its best to â€œgreenwashâ€ their so-called Dino-Juice fuels as well as oil exploration even in pristine environments. They are very closely linked to the political establishments, especially the far-Right and Conservative ones in both developed and developing countries. Some of them have actually urged Governments to roll back RE initiatives. They also try to mislead consumers on RE and BEVs, which could be one reason why BEV sales have fallen in certain key markets.\nBut make no mistake, RE and BEVs are the future. Governments must be bold enough to phase out fossil fuels both for energy generation and transport as soon as possible. Most countries including Sri Lanka have set a realistic target (2035) in this regard and they must stick to it, despite the ugly machinations of the fossil fuel lobby.\nThe post A tipping point for Renewable Energy appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-05-11','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/05/12/editorial/23019/a-tipping-point-for-renewable-energy/'),(166,'Cricket: going global','Cricket, the quintessential English sport, was once more popular than baseball in the United States, a fact that is hard to believe or comprehend now. Today, cricket is the second most watched sport in the world, next only to soccer. While only around 10 countries play the sport at the highest level (Test matches), almost 100 countries play at associate or other leagues within the International Cricket Council (ICC) structure.\nBaseball, though very similar to cricket since it is also a bat and ball sport, has only a limited footprint, being played at the highest level only in the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea and a few other countries. But one cannot deny that the sport has a huge following in these countries.\nBut interest in cricket in both US and Canada was rekindled with the arrival of immigrants from South Asia, where cricket reigns supreme. After all, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have all won the Cricket World Cup. This led to the formation of cricket clubs in the main cities of Canada and US. Gradually, the native population also began to note this intriguing sport. As these clubs blossomed to the point of having tournaments, another groundbreaking development was taking place in the cricket world.\nLetâ€™s face it, Test cricket, though undoubtedly the purest form of the sport, can be rather boring, compared to sports such as football and baseball, which generally run only for three or a maximum four hours. On the other hand, even a 50 overs cricket match runs for a full day. Most people do not have the time or the inclination to watch a match for one whole day, leave alone five days. Thus cricket administrators stuck upon the brilliant formula of Twenty20 cricket, whereby each team gets to bat for just 20 overs. If team A gets 200 runs in their allotted 20 overs, team B has to score 201 runs in 20 overs. The best thing is that it only takes around three hours. It has thus been described as â€œcricket on steroidsâ€.\nNow, international Twenty20 matches are included in all bilateral series and a T20 Cricket World Cup was also started. Sri Lanka won this tournament exactly 10 years ago, 18 years after their magnificent victory in the 50 Overs World Cup in Lahore, Pakistan. Cricket also received a big boost with the start of franchise leagues around the world, where teams are cobbled together from a smattering of foreign and local players. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest such franchise league in the world.\nAlthough many say that these franchise leagues are â€œnot just cricketâ€ as the saying goes, there is no doubt that they have raised the profile of the sport globally and increased its visibility. In fact, the success of these franchise T20 leagues has spurred the establishment of a T20 cricket franchise tournament in the US itself. It is yet to reach the level of Major League Baseball (MLB), but given the South Asian Diaspora in North America, it could get there.\nEven 10 years ago, if someone said a Cricket World Cup could be held in the US, he would have been laughed out of hand. But now, the boot is literally on the other foot as the US is hosting the T20 Cricket World Cup for the very first time, along with the more established West Indies. This is the biggest breakthrough for cricket in North America in recent memory.\nEven more significantly, the US is getting two renovated and one all-new cricket stadia to host 16 matches of the tournament, which started yesterday. The stadia in New York, Texas and Florida will hopefully be dedicated to cricket once the tournament ends, helping to popularise the game in the Land of the Free, although the one in New York is modular and can easily be dismantled and refitted elsewhere. With more exposure, Americans and Canadians might get used to this beautiful game. Indeed, that other beautiful game â€“ soccer â€“ has gained a sizable following in the US after a franchise model was introduced. Cricket might have a similar trajectory.\nThe ICC was heavily criticised for limiting the previous recent editions of all World Cups to the elite cricket playing countries. This limits the opportunities of emerging nations to play against the top teams and also the broadest coverage. This simple theory was well understood by World Rugby, which has vastly expanded the number of nations in their most recent edition of the World Cup. Rugby, also played by a limited number of countries, faced the same challenge of taking it to more corners of the world. Since the expansion, rugby has gained traction in many more countries.\nThis time, sanity has prevailed at the ICC. They have expanded the tournament to cover 20 nations, including of course, the US. Among the other lesser known countries are Oman, Canada, Namibia, Uganda, PNG and Nepal. From the Test playing nations, only Zimbabwe has been left out, as it was unable to qualify.\nRecent newcomers to the Test arena Ireland and Afghanistan are also in the fray, along with the Netherlands, which has been playing cricket at this level for almost two decades. Participating in the T20 World Cup will give cricket in these countries a tremendous boost, encouraging more youngsters to take up the sport in addition to or instead of soccer, the planetâ€™s number one sport. The ICC must, however, keep the momentum going, by investing further in the cricket infrastructure of these emerging nations and giving them regular tournaments and tours.\nThe post Cricket: going global appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-06-01','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/02/editorial/24530/cricket-going-global/'),(167,'A new era for Singapore','Unlike many Asian countries where political volatility is the norm, Singapore rarely witnesses political upheavals of any kind. In this sense, the City State is a bastion of stability, both politically and economically.\nSingaporeâ€™s success on the world stage â€“ from the sleepy backwater it was when Sir Stamford Raffles took control in 1819 to the financial powerhouse it is today â€“ can largely be attributed to the vision and perseverance of one legendary Statesman â€“ Lee Kuan Yew. Incidentally, he was an ardent admirer of Sri Lanka who wanted to model Singapore after that Pearl of the Indian Ocean, but was dismayed by its downward spiral in an ethnic imbroglio.\nThus he made racial amity a cornerstone of his policies for Singapore and curbed corruption to the maximum possible extent. There may be other reasons, but these are the two main factors that transformed Singapore to the status of a developed nation while its neighbouring countries stagnated.\nLee Kuan yew was succeeded in the Premierâ€™s position by his son Lee Hsien Loong. One may call it nepotism or dynastic politics, but unlike in many other Asian countries where it is a synonym for corruption, Loong (72) took Singapore to an even higher level.\nBut in grooming a set of future political leaders outside his family circle â€“ the so-called 4G group â€“ he also made certain that Singapore would get out of dynastic politics. In his final major speech on May 1, Lee urged people to rally behind the incoming Prime Minister and emphasised that Singaporeâ€™s stable politics had enabled long-term planning.\nNow, in a seismic shift for the tiny but mighty country, Peopleâ€™s Action Party (PAP) 4G frontliner Lawrence Wong has been sworn in as Singaporeâ€™s first new Prime Minister in 20 years. In fact, he is only its fourth leader since Independence in 1965 and the carefully calibrated power transfer is aimed at ensuring continuity in the wealthy City State. Wong is also the first Singaporean leader born after its Independence.\nAfter assuming office in a televised ceremony, Wong pledged to lead â€œwith humility and a deep sense of dutyâ€ towards Singapore and its six million people. He promised to devote â€œevery ounce of my energyâ€ to them. At just 51, time and age are firmly on his side as he seeks to continue the momentum that has propelled Singapore to its prime position. Wongâ€™s expertise as an economist and his retention of the Finance portfolio will also come in useful as Singapore faces global economic headwinds.\nWong rose to prominence in 2020 as co-chairperson of the Pandemic Task Force (PTF) and was named Leeâ€™s successor in April 2022 after a series of consultations between the political leadership and his peers. He was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister and led a high-profile public consultation exercise to chart a â€œSocial Compactâ€ between the Government and the people on dealing with issues such as sustainability, inequality and employment.\nâ€œThis is a passing of the baton not just between leadership teams but also across generations,â€ Wong said. â€œWe will lead in our own way. We will continue to think boldly and think far.â€ These are bold words that Singaporeans need to hear now more than ever, but surprisingly, Wong was not the first choice for the PMâ€™s post. That honour went to Heng Swee Keat, a former Central Bank Chief and Education Minister. However, he withdrew his nomination in 2021. This paved the way for Wongâ€™s prominence and rise. Premier Wong has warned that Singapore must brace for a â€œmessier, riskier and more violent worldâ€ by staying united and blazing new trails. Indeed, these words apply to all countries in our region, not just Singapore.\nBeing at the crossroads of the East-West shipping routes, Singapore literally has to straddle the regionâ€™s increasingly volatile geopolitical waters, with a rising China on one side and the US and its allies on the other. However, Singapore has been adroitly balancing its foreign policy imperatives without falling into the orbit of any side. Singaporeâ€™s own unique governing model may have something to do with this ambivalence. Nevertheless, Singapore has been quietly building up its defence capacity and capability to face any eventuality. Wong has received the reins of his island nation at a critical juncture in this context.\nDomestically, Premier Wong will have to worry about factors such as the falling birth rate, the housing and rental crisis, the Climate Crisis (a critical factor for a small island) and even the repercussions of a still-reverberating corruption scandal involving former senior Minister S. Iswaran as well as a romantic scandal involving two PAP personalities. These have unfortunately smeared Singaporeâ€™s zero-corruption reputation and Wong will have to crack the whip harder in this regard. A resurgent Opposition could also pose a greater challenge to the PAP at the next General Election due in 2025, though a victory for the PA is certain at this stage.\nRelations between Sri Lanka and Singapore have always been excellent and to this day, Singapore is one of the very few countries that grant visa-free access to Sri Lankan citizens. The two countries have also signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that will spur two-way trade by eliminating tariffs for 80 percent of all tariff lines through staging periods of up to 15 years. There is no doubt that this robust relationship will reach greater heights under Premier Wongâ€™s watch.\nThe post A new era for Singapore appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-05-18','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/05/19/editorial/23595/a-new-era-for-singapore/'),(168,'Let sanity prevail','The recent move by the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) to offer medical graduate courses on a fee-levying basis has created an uproar, with some elements throwing a spanner in the works. The Government Medical Officersâ€™ Association (GMOA), which itself previously acknowledged the glaring shortage of doctors in Government hospitals, has however, opposed every move to broaden medical education, starting with the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC), then the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and now, the KDU. This, at a time when the paucity of doctors has been aggravated by the mass migration of doctors.\nTheir opposition defies logic, especially in the light of reports that many students who have missed out on admission to the State medical colleges by just a few marks have applied for the KDU course. This gives the lie to the allegation that even those who have failed the GCE Advanced Level examination could apply and become doctors. But the best point is not even that â€“ the KDU course fee is just Rs.12.5 million, whereas just one year in a foreign university will cost that amount. One can imagine the savings in terms of foreign exchange. This in itself could be a lifeline for our foreign reserves.\nIf students peruse the Education section of this newspaper, they will realise that there are plenty of Government and private educational institutions that can offer similar globally recognised courses and degrees at a fraction of the cost of overseas universities. Students sometimes get the option of completing the course in another country and even gaining employment and Permanent Residency (PR).\nSaving foreign exchange is often cited as the cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre of establishing more private universities and indeed it is. Just imagine the savings even if the country saves just US$ 1,000 per year per student, as thousands of Sri Lankan students already study in foreign universities, with more leaving every day. Even more than the financial aspect, local private universities will give the students the option of studying the desired subjects with the advantage of living with their families in a familiar environment.\nQuite apart from saving foreign exchange, private universities can actually help earn foreign exchange by enrolling foreign students. If Sri Lanka has world-class private universities, just like Malaysia, Belarus and Australia, students will be attracted to them especially from Africa and Asia, as food and lodging cost much less here.\nMoreover, private universities are necessarily job-oriented, unlike some State universities which offer courses that have no relevance in the modern world. It is very difficult to get a job by following these courses â€“ indeed, Sri Lanka is perhaps the only country to have a so-called Unemployed Graduates Association. Private universities will also address the problem of studentsâ€™ poor English knowledge and also leave no opportunity for ragging.\nGaining admission to a State University in Sri Lanka is not easy by any means. The Advanced Level examination is very competitive and of the 100,000 who qualify for university admission, only around 30,000 actually enter the universities every year. It is thus a rare privilege. There should be more educational opportunities for the rest. This is another reason why we need private universities.\nWhile private universities and educational institutions offering various courses have gained ground in Sri Lanka without much resistance, there is still a debate over the establishment of private medical universities. However, with the flight of doctors in search of greener pastures and the limited intake of students to State medical colleges, the Government has now decided to establish at least three private medical colleges and several other private universities. This time, the Government must be firm in its stance, without giving into the demands of those who oppose private universities and private medical colleges.\nThis must be established through an Act of Parliament, covered by a National Policy on Education that essentially recognises private universities including private medical colleges. In fact, this is what several of our neighbouring countries have done.\nFor example, in Bangladesh, its Parliament passed the Private University Act of 1992. Now, there are nearly 100 approved private universities in Bangladesh. In India and Nepal too, legal protection is provided to private universities.\nThe main reason for some student organisationsâ€™ agitation against the opening of private investments in university education is the incorrect perception that private universities would harm the present free education system in Sri Lanka.\nIf you look at other countries, this line of thinking is completely wrong. State and private universities complement each other. The competition will be among private universities themselves for the rankings and prestige. The final beneficiaries would be the students. Moreover, State universities will also strive to improve their World University Rankings.\nThe time has come to end the debate on private universities once and for all. The Government should take a firm stand to establish more private universities regardless of the pressure from various quarters. Opposition parties including the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the National Peopleâ€™s Power (NPP) must also clarify their stance on private universities. The abolition of SAITM has cost the country dearly in terms of the number of doctors who would have qualified by now. There must be no room for such short-sighted actions again.\nThe post Let sanity prevail appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-05-04','Editorial',NULL,'https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/05/05/editorial/22461/let-sanity-prevail/'),(169,'Aruna Darshana qualifies','Sri Lanka Athletics (SLA) yesterday confirmed that Aruna Darshana has officially qualified to represent Sri Lanka at the Paris Olympics.\nHe will become the sixth member of the team of athletes.

The Labour Party, that won a â€˜landslideâ€™ election of sorts, offers a stable regime with a strong Parliamentary majority and, a new generation of youngish, â€˜smartâ€™ politicians.\nThis is seen as a refreshing change after more than a decade of hopelessly old-style, even decadent (remember the Covid-19 â€˜partygateâ€™?), governance by the Conservative Party. â€œChangeâ€ was very much part of Labourâ€™s campaign spiel.\nThe Kingdomâ€™s new Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, QC, KCB, is known mainly for his demure style â€“ news media calls him â€œdullâ€ and â€œblandâ€ â€“ but he is an accomplished legal technocrat and activist. His new glamour as his partyâ€™s dramatically successful leader after 14 years out of power, actually complements an already impressive political and professional career of rapid achievements.\nThe 61-year-old Queenâ€™s Counsel has won professional awards for human rights legal activism and a sustained social service of hundreds of pro bono appearances. They include successfully defending scores of death sentence appeals for criminal cases in several Caribbean and African countries of the Commonwealth.\nComplementing his professional career is also Starmerâ€™s service as Director of Public Prosecutions of England and Wales. He also served as an advisor on policing matters in Northern Ireland â€“ that long-sidelined territory that, since 1169, remains Britainâ€™s earliest colony.\nKnight Commander\nIn the 2014 â€˜royal honoursâ€™, Starmer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (of the British â€œEmpireâ€, of course) for â€œservices to law and criminal justiceâ€. This is the youngest of the three orders of chivalry of the UK, after the more exclusive knightly orders of the Garter and the Thistle.\nOn Friday, Sir Kier became the first UK Prime Minister in 61 years who was already a Knight of the Realm on assuming office (since Sir Alec Douglas-Home became Premier as a Knight in 1963). Usually, politicians are knighted at the end of their careers.\nAlthough head of the Left-wing Labour Party and, himself the son of a south London industry technician, Starmer studied in private schools and ended up doing law in Oxford. He met and married his wife while both were practising attorneys in London. They have a teenage son and daughter.\nWhatever their politics, both are quietly fashionable and known for their youthful â€˜chicâ€™. Greater London-born and bred Starmer is known as an â€˜Arsenal fanaticâ€™ (for the inner-city football club).\nIn an interview with Starmer after he became party leader this March, the elitist â€˜Vogueâ€™ magazine drools over the Labour leaderâ€™s very un-working class dress ensembles: â€œhis signature navy suits are all Charles Tyrwhitt, and, when not in leader mode, heâ€™s partial to Adidas trainers and Stone Island polos.â€\nâ€œA sartorial choice that got him called â€œThe New Hooligan in Townâ€ from an approving fanblog,â€ notes an equally approving â€˜Vogueâ€™. And, â€œ..thereâ€™s not a hair out of place on the silver quiff that is so distinctive it has its own Instagram account: @ratingstarmershair.â€ Anglophiles, go to!\nLabour has won the 2024 General Election with a convincing majority of 176. Labour now has 412 of the House of Commons seats and the Conservatives 121.\nOn Friday, Starmer appointed his 25-member Cabinet of Ministers which made history with the highest number of women ministers â€“ 11. They include Rachel Reeves, the UKâ€™s first female Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister), and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.\nThe Cabinet also includes a Black Britisher and also two South Asian Brits. All the Cabinet has solid histories of political experience in previous administrations or shadow cabinets as well as professional experience in different fields.\nCentrist\nMost analysts read Labourâ€™s impressive victory more as a large scale anti-incumbency vote and also an expression of economic desperation by the poorer classes, rather than an ideological shift Leftwards. They note that Starmer today has, himself, significantly shifted towards the Right within his party.\nMost opinion polls had indicated voter disgust over the divisive politics that plagued the Conservative Party regime these past 14 years that saw no less than five Tory governments due to inner party rebellions and six Prime Ministers, some of them in office for just weeks. The number of instances of political betrayals among colleagues in Government that then led to sackings and re-shuffles and, worse, the collapse of regimes, all led to public disillusionment over the Tories fitness to rule.\nAlso upsetting the British public were the number of incidents of decadent Tory life-style, including one Prime Ministerâ€™s in-house office parties during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns when such gatherings were prohibited. Another Prime Minister more recently exited early from the annual war commemoration ceremony in London causing a furore.\nBut what probably was the most decisive factor in the Conservative downfall was the systematic whittling away of the UKâ€™s long-prized social welfare system degrading both good health care and, good education and skills training. Many people had begun comparing the UK in recent years to conditions of a Third World country rather than that of the First World.\nThere is much expectation, especially among the mass of British poor, of some roll-back of the Conservative regimeâ€™s drastic reduction of state subsidised social facilities like public health, public education, public transport, and public housing. Labour has indeed promised such a roll-back of the old Thatcherite Neo-liberalism that is seen as heartless and socially insensitive and potentially risking long term social instability.\nSignificantly, the new Cabinet indicates a careful mix of the Left and Right within the Labour hierarchy. Analysts see the mix as indicative of a very centrist foreign policy. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on addressing domestic devolution issues with the new ministers for Wales and Northern Ireland both known for their political competence in their respective areas.\nAt the same time, there is not likely to be any significant change in the UKâ€™s engagement with the EU with the relevant ministers known for not favouring any re-joining of the Union.\nThe UK is clearly also set to continue with its hawkishly anti-Russian stance on the Ukraine war while sustaining its current hardline support for Israelâ€™s genocidal war and systematic colonising of the land of Palestine. If London cannot even reconsider its 800-year colonial occupation of Northern Ireland, how can the world expect any redress of the UKâ€™s deliberate backing for the European Jewish colonisation of Palestine?\nHow much London will shift in its stance of following Washington in its approach to China also remains to be seen.\nMeanwhile, a newly elected regime also begins its term in Tehran after Fridayâ€™s run-off vote contest between a very conservative, long time administration bureaucrat and, a moderate reform-oriented legislator and medical professional. The reformist is Masoud Pezeshkian, the sole moderate in the original field of four candidates, and, his rival was one-time hardline nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.\nMany in the West â€“ and expansionist Israel â€“ would have preferred Jalili in power so that the West could more easily continue to demonise the currently most assertive West Asian power that is seen as the principal obstacle to the Westâ€™s dominance over the energy-rich region. Jalili is also very close the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iranâ€™s most powerful and regionally most influential military force.\nBut the Iranian people, although considerably disillusioned with the overall Islamic republican set-up, have voted wisely. Firstly, the more progressive, liberal-minded, citizenry, responded to the call by reformists to actively vote in the run-off poll. And they have pushed through their democratic decision.\nMasoud Pezeshkian has won. The countryâ€™s Interior Ministry yesterday announced: â€œBy gaining majority of the votes cast on Friday, Pezeshkian has become Iranâ€™s next president.â€\nThe vote count announced by the Ministry put Pezeshkian as the winner with 16.3 million votes to Jaliliâ€™s 13.5 million.\nNews media reported that Pezeshkianâ€™s supporters had crowded the streets of Tehran and other cities before dawn yesterday (Saturday) to celebrate the victory. This belies the claims by Western news media of political apathy among Iranians.\nVoter participation in the run-off came close 50 percent after much public appeals to voters led by the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameini himself. The run-off on Friday followed a June 28 first round vote with historically low turnout.\nApparently, over 60 percent of Iranian voters abstained from the June 28 snap poll called to elect a successor to President Ebrahim Raisi, who died suddenly in a helicopter crash.\nReform\nWhile some western media painted the newly elected President as being â€œpro-Westâ€, a deeper understanding of current Iranian politics indicates differently.\nAll four original contestants in the snap election â€“ just like the late President Raisi â€“ were staunch supporters of the Islamic Republic. They would not have been approved as candidates if they had not been so, given Iranâ€™s tightly controlled electoral candidatesâ€™ vetting process.\nWhat this means is that the â€˜reformâ€™ dimension is about domestic change, especially in the space for citizens to play more active roles in society and polity both at local and national level.\nAt the same time, the appointment of a technocrat like Pezeshkian will certainly enable a more meticulous management of the economy and administration. Iran is being battered by the harsh sanctions regime imposed and enforced by the Western power bloc and, strenuous and creative efforts are needed to cope with the crippling effects.\nFortunately, the new global geopolitical shifts, with the emergence of new powers in the Global South, provide some useful networks of economic and political support for Iran and other victims of Western big power bullying.\nIn this light, most analysts do not see any serious change in Iranâ€™s foreign policy under President Pezeshkian.\nThe post UKâ€™s new â€˜smartâ€™ Premier wins mass vote for economic recovery appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-07-06','Opinion','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tag-SO-World-Sub-continent.jpg','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/opinion/27329/uks-new-smart-premier-wins-mass-vote-for-economic-recovery/'),(173,'Debt as friend or foe?','We are not out of debt, but we have deflected our debt component. The result is that we are now excused from having to pay a mountain of debt immediately, but are also somehow deemed creditworthy which means Fitch and other ratings agencies would grant us the useful nod.\nSo debt, it is seen, has many dimensions. It is one thing to be in debt, another to incur debt, and still entirely a different matter to be deemed creditworthy.\nCreditworthiness is essentially a matter of how astutely a country is able to convince certain creditor nations and others how good they are as a potential borrower nation in the future. International debt is different from, say individuals incurring debt to banks. That variety of debt is not written off.\nCorrection: that variety of debt is rarely written off. There are favoured banking clientele that may get off lightly, and not have to pay massive sums they have borrowed. Countries in our South Asian neighbourhood do not exactly have millionaires and billionaires of the Elon Musk persuasion, by the way. The likes of Musk made their own money, and made enormous wads of it at that.\nSTATE HANDOUTS\nPresidents such as Donald Trump then chased after them to make use of their money and their wisdom, whenever possible. But in countries such as ours, the rich have not quite reached the zenith without generous State handouts by way of debt write-offs by banks. Either that or they have got monopoly State tenders or State contracts that make them rich, because they are given exclusive rights over a certain product or service. So the Elon Musks of this world are rich men who came by wealth by dint of hard work and some innovation, and contributed their fair share to progress. Our Uber rich by contrast got there by virtue of State concessions, and want more.\nBut back to the subject of national debt. This was not a subject up for discussion when the health of the economy was discussed in the 50s or the 60s. There was a time pre-Independence and immediately post-Independence reputedly, when we were a creditor nation and bankrolled Britain when necessary, of course, with Britain being war ravaged and us conveniently being a colony. But nevertheless, national debt never came up as a subject for discussion during those early days.\nBut the debt issue is a subject of national focus now, and depending on the exact circumstances, even a subject of national celebration. When we get a debt reprieve of sorts, we cheer because debt is as stark a reality as night follows day in this country.\nDebt also means that we are internationally connected as a country and are respected, it has been argued. But this is so long as our debt is deemed sustainable and we are not seen as a defaulter, or a bankrupt entity. So, recently, we jumped that hurdle and negotiated our loan repayments fully, we are told.\nCan this be taken to mean that we are a fully globalised nation? (The reasoning being that debt-repaying and creditworthy nations are deemed sufficiently globalised). There will be two sides to this argument. Back here, people overwhelmingly would be naturally somewhat sceptical about such a representation of events. People have seen debt to be malignant during the economic meltdown of 2022.\nThey see that debt repayments have been negotiated now, but overall they cannot be expected to change their minds on the nature of debt, given that they are also aware that all of them and future generations bear the burden of repaying that debt that has been negotiated.\nBut some of the debt has been virtually written off, though vast amounts still have to be paid. Some would see this as signalling that we are increasingly a globalised participant in the economy, being able to meet the vagaries of the commercial debt market. That we are able to negotiate our debt successfully would be taken as further proof that we are a consummate globalised player.\nBut is â€˜playerâ€™ a right word at all, given all of the connotations it has? People who have borne the brunt of the country being saddled in debt and paid the price for default in 2022 by undergoing immense hardships, would be scandalised if not amused if they are told that we are also by the way an international player, and that we are, at the end of the day, a consummate participant in the global economy, debt and all things bundled into the equation.\nMANY FACETS\nYes, there are many facets of debt. But, debt if mismanaged, particularly foreign currency debt, can have harmful effects on economies as we do not have any control over the currencies in which we are supposed to pay back. Several countries are undergoing debt-stress or are in acute severe debt-stress because they are unable to pay back in dollars or Euros, and the fact is they are a debtor and not a player, until this debt is either negotiated or settled in time.\nCreditworthy countries do not have to ponder such issues and you would not hear of this same conversation happening in Singapore, for instance. But countries such as ours can pass from being creditworthy to un-creditworthy in different phases.\nAt present, we are said to be creditworthy or creditworthy in a manner of speaking. We have negotiated our debt, though payments have been also kept in abeyance for the most part. If that makes us a participant in the globalised economy, so be it. It means we would be able to borrow more and that is both a good portend and a terrible portend, considering that we have recently been so bad at managing our debt.\nThe other facet is that debt is so much a part of our internal political dialogue. This is taken to mean that our sovereignty itself is compromised, at least in some interpretations. Some political analysts are of the view that there is no such thing as absolute sovereignty and that if debt impacts sovereignty, it is unfortunate reality and is par for the course, because we are not the only country in debt.\nINTEGRAL PART\nThe problem is that debt has become so much of an integral part in our national conversation that it is overbearing. It is in other words now, central to our discourse. War used to be central to our discourse several years back, but now debt is, though some would qualify that to say it is the economy we are worried about and debt is but a part of it.\nWhichever way we slice that, it is debt that became our problem and so, another facet of debt is that we have learnt to live with it, whether it signifies us as being an international player or not. It couldnâ€™t be stressed enough that being characterised as a â€˜playerâ€™ is small comfort to people whose cost-of-living had skyrocketed due to debt and effects of debt-default. But yet, our national psyche is now conditioned to the fact that we have to deal with debt. There is no cry for instance, from any quarter, to aim to be entirely debt free. Debt is merely considered a necessary evil.\nThat should have been fine if we are progressing, and strictly only if we are progressing in terms of economic development. Such progress is not necessarily dependent on infrastructure upgrades for instance, by making use of foreign debt, though infrastructure development overall is taken to be good, as it improves the quality of life. This is arguable in cases where debt has compromised a nation such as ours so much, that we couldnâ€™t import essentials, as happened in the past. But we are said to be over that now and on a path to progress. But a lot of those assessments would have to be made later, when we see the results while we start repaying our debt substantially. That is another facet of debt.\nDebt becomes a constant companion in our national journey that we find difficult to shake off. We hope to, therefore, be in companionable terms with debt in the long and near term future. Down the road, we expect to always encounter the debt spectre, in its varying and evolving incarnations.\nThe post Debt as friend or foe? appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-07-06','Opinion','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/8-3.jpg','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/opinion/27339/debt-as-friend-or-foe/'),(174,'Debt restructuring and Sri Lankaâ€™s future','An expert discussion was held last Friday (5) at the Government Information Department regarding Sri Lankaâ€™s worst economic collapse since its independence and measures taken to boost the countryâ€™s economy. The discussion emphasized Sri Lankaâ€™s dire need for an economic transformation and the Government presented the Economic Transformation Act which will make the changes towards this end. It is an essential Bill during this time. The experts also said that a country does not progress by merely presenting a Bill and the new Bill has a broad vision including creating a strong network of institutions and a program to be implemented.\nNo regime can govern for more than two weeks if they exit the IMF process â€“ Minister of Transport, Highways and Mass Media Dr. Bandula Gunawardena\nMy main aim is to raise awareness about the political measures taken regarding the situation. The current account deficit of the State budget and the current account deficit of the balance of payments can be said to be the two worst deficits in the past few decades after independence.\nAs a Cabinet minister, an explanation should be given regarding the action taken to boost Sri Lankaâ€™s economy.\nNo matter who is in charge, the Government of Sri Lanka does not have enough income and receipts to bear the expenses that have to be borne again and again, as a result of the expenses incurred in the daily running of the State. For example, last yearâ€™s audited financial report by the Auditor General explains that the Government spent on government employeesâ€™ salaries, pensions of senior citizens, Samurdhi, Aswasuma, other household subsidies and travel expenses. The amount available is Rs. 4.7 trillion. The amount received by the Treasury from new taxes imposed on everyone, direct taxes, goods taken by everyone regardless of income level, indirect taxes, non-tax income such as profits, dividends, interest, grants, and other deposits is three trillion.\nThe Central Bank has maintained its outstanding Rs. 1.7 trillion with the money received from the weekly Treasury Bill auction. At the time of violent protests, the Government presented a supplementary estimate and paid money by drawing money from the Central Bank, but according to the new law, it has now been banned.\nTo maintain its economy, the country must import consumer goods such as lentils, yams, onions, chillies, intermediate goods such as mineral oil, bulk chemicals and machinery and equipment from the external economy. Without it, people cannot survive. For that purpose, agricultural exports such as tea, rubber, coconuts and industrial exports such as textiles and garments were used to generate income from the export of gems and other minerals, but there is still a deficit in the trade account after 1977. There is not enough income from overseas Sri Lankans or tourism receipts to cover that deficit and the balance of payments; deficit as well as the current account deficit have been affected in all the years except last year.\nTo cover these two deficits, every regime had continuously taken loans. There, concessional loans were taken from the World Bank, and Asian Development Bank, IMF, but when the concessional loans were not enough, when the money was not enough, sovereign bonds were issued in the market and a large loan was taken. Development bonds have been issued. Not being able to pay all of them has officially informed that the loan cannot be paid. Before that, with the assumption of power by President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, he requested the Cabinet to come forward with someone who is capable of recovering the country from this situation.\nWhen faced with collapse, 28 companies that provide advisory expert services came forward and 20 of them were qualified. The Cabinet appointed a sub-committee to decide on who can be entrusted with this responsibility. Prof. GL Peiris, a Cabinet Minister at that time, was appointed as its chairman. The responsibility was assigned to Franceâ€™s Lazard agency and the Clifford Chance firm was appointed with Cabinet approval to provide legal advice and to appear in courts regarding the crises in the financial sector. In the meantime, proposals were made to go to the IMF as the last lender, but due to division in the Cabinet at that time, they could not go together to the IMF. After that, the countryâ€™s economy collapsed and a crisis arose. Then the amount of reserve was short. There were queues.\nThe people were blinded by hatred. Houses of peopleâ€™s representatives were burnt. Eight -hundred houses were destroyed. President Ranil Wickremesinghe accepted the challenge of recovering the country as a leader with political experience as a five-time Prime Minister when the country was in a state of anarchy and he took necessary steps. That is why the debt restructuring agreements were reached.\nNo regime can govern this country for more than two weeks if they leave the IMF process. So-called experts who do not understand this are spouting lies. They are trying to drag this country back to the era of fuel and gas queues and blackouts.\n\nThis is a moment when Sri Lanka is expecting an economic transformation more than ever before- Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe\nThe present can be described as a moment when Sri Lanka is expecting an economic transformation more than ever before. The Government has presented the Economic Transformation Bill, which will make a huge contribution towards fulfilling those expectations. It is the most necessary Bill for the country.\nA country does not progress by merely presenting a Bill, and the new Bill has outlined a broad vision including creating a strong network of institutions and a program to be implemented according to that Bill. All those who worked on it deserve our thanks and respect.\nSo far, we have made great progress in restructuring Sri Lankaâ€™s domestic and foreign debts. It is my duty to make an explanation about it.\nThe first thing to mention here is that it has emerged that it is impossible to pay the Government debt by the year 2020, 2021. In the year 2020, the International Monetary Fund was giving financial grants to any country without conditions during the Covid -19 pandemic.\nAt that time, the International Monetary Fund did not agree to give it to Sri Lanka. The reason is that our country is unable to repay the debt. Our country was unable to get an emergency loan facility due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe reason for this is the continuous decrease in Government revenue. In this context, the Government announced that it has temporarily suspended the payment of the loan taken on April 12, 2020. Government debt, bilateral and multilateral debt and international sovereign debt had to be restructured. One party here is the Sri Lankan government. Those are the borrowers. The other party is the lender. The two groups worked to reach an agreement on debt restructuring, with the International Monetary Fund acting as an arbiter. On March 18, 2022, we reached a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund for the first time to come out of the crisis.\nAccordingly, in the next 10 years, they agreed to work according to many other goals such as reducing Government debt, increasing Government revenue, and increasing export revenue.\nWe are working with the support of the International Monetary Fund and it was a great strength in the journey to make the debt optimally sustainable. First, we optimsed the domestic debt. It was done in September 2023. Here we had to make a small contribution to the debts we had to pay.\nThe second phase will be the restructuring of bilateral foreign debt. It happened on June 26. The Paris Club and India, Japan, France and China agreed to this debt restructuring. There we got more time to repay the debt we owed. The amount of interest decreased. This is our victory. After that, it was possible to restructure the debt with international sovereign bond holders on the July 4. Fifty percent of those creditors agreed with us for this discussion. Based on this agreement, Sri Lanka will have the opportunity to get the most appropriate concessions according to the criteria accepted by the International Monetary Fund and their analysis.\nNothing will be deducted from the funds provided by them during bilateral debt restructuring. The only relief is to increase the loan repayment period or reduce the interest rates.\nIn the restructuring of debt with private creditors, arrangements will be made to provide Sri Lanka with a comparative relief commensurate with the repayment capacity of the debt and the relief obtained in the aforementioned foreign bilateral and multilateral debt restructuring. In determining the concessions we expect from the creditors, we will also deeply analyse and make a decision about the growth that Sri Lanka will achieve economically in the next 5-10 years, and our ability to achieve the targets of increasing government revenues. For this, the agreement of the International Monetary Fund and international official creditors should be obtained.\nAs Sri Lanka begins to advance economically by developing its capacity to pay off debt, efforts will be made to raise the grade given to us by foreign credit rating agencies.\n\nGovt is moving towards a sustainable economic program that wonâ€™t collapse again- Presidential Senior Economic Adviser Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga\nThe debt restructuring program with various creditors has been successfully carried out so far to sustainably repay domestic and foreign loans taken by Sri Lanka. The Government and the authorities worked to achieve this success and the Government has now taken steps to prevent an economic collapse. A very solid program has been prepared and President Ranil Wickremesinghe gave it the needed leadership.\nThe Government presented more than 60 new and amended Ordinances to meet the economic and social development goals. About 30 of them are leading Acts related to economic management. Among these Bills, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act presented on September 15, 2023, the Public Debt Management Act, the Act incorporating new laws on procurement and the Economic Transformation Act take priority.\nThere are mainly four institutions to deal with public debt management. They manage public debt in various ways. But no single institution has been established for this purpose. It has been proposed to set up a single agency under the new Public Debt Management Act to fill this gap.\nIn such an environment, the Economic Transformation Act, which has a very timely and far-sighted vision, has been introduced by the current Government. This Act is a composite Act. There are five Acts in this. As far as I know in the history of Sri Lanka, the Act that was presented in the 1980s which was presented together with three Acts related to the field of vocational training can be called as a composite act. Then you presented five Bills together, one of the Bills that we need to know more about is the Economic Transformation Act.\nSri Lanka has a small economy. Its value is 85 billion US dollars. Our resources are limited. We must work to use this limited amount of resources efficiently and effectively. For that, we need new research and training. The new Economic Transformation Act provides guidelines to achieve these goals. In this Act, more weight has been placed to fulfill three main things aiming to create Government debt sustainability in three main areas.\nSri Lanka currently has 128 percent domestic and foreign debt as a percentage of GDP. It is aimed to reduce it to 95 percent. Currently, the Governmentâ€™s foreign debt as a percentage of GDP is 9.4 percent. It is aimed to reduce it to 4.5 percent.\nNot only this, but the overall gross domestic product has been targeted to grow by more than five percent year on year. It aims to reduce unemployment and increase womenâ€™s labour contribution to economic development. It is aimed to increase it to 25 percent by next year, 40 percent in 2030 and 50 percent in 2040.\nIt is a victory we have achieved. The Economic Transformation Act aims to achieve debt sustainability. Accordingly, a program has been outlined to achieve it. In this way, it is special that not only plans but also a program to implement the new act, which we can introduce as a comprehensive act, is given in the act itself.\nSri Lanka was very poor in the 1950s and 60s. Even at that time, the Governmentâ€™s income as a percentage of the gross domestic product exceeded 20 percent. By the mid-1990s, Sri Lanka had become a middle-income country. In that era too, Government revenue as a percentage of GDP remained at the level of 22 percent and 18 percent. Sri Lanka, which received such a high level of Government income, by the 2020s, the Government income as a percentage of the gross domestic product fell to eight percent, nine percent. At this time, Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP has exceeded 20 percent. In this way, it will be difficult to move a country when the government expenditure is high and the Government revenue is at a low level. Thus, Sri Lanka had become a country with one of the lowest incomes in the world. After getting rid of that situation, we have increased the countryâ€™s income to 10 percent â€“ 11 percent. It is also not enough anymore. Accordingly, we should work to reach the level of 15 percent, 16 percent in the next few years. The goals for them are also stated in the new Act.\nThe Economic Transformation Act aims to overcome two challenges that Sri Lanka has been facing. These goals are to reduce the high budget gap and reduce the foreign trade deficit. To overcome this, export income should be increased. Foreign direct income should be increased. For that we need to use new knowledge. Technology should be integrated. We must do our work efficiently and effectively. For this purpose, a number of existing institutions have been abolished and five new institutions have been established for socio-economic development. Working with the establishment of these five institutions, the welfare and development of the entire people should be achieved through the results of all economic activities.\nThe establishment of the Sri Lanka Economic Commission, the establishment of an institution for the regularisation of Sri Lanka investment zones, the establishment of the institution for the promotion of foreign trade, the establishment of a National Productivity Commission, and the establishment of an intelligence board to take steps to promote international trade. Here, for the National Productivity Commission, every institution will be integrated and efforts will be made to create a situation where the country and the society will benefit from every rupee of investment made by the Government and private individuals. Through this, the Government expects to make Sri Lanka a prosperous and developed country by establishing debt sustainability, regardless of the government under the Economic Transformation Act.\n\nGoals should be based on three things to get rid of the debt crisis- Senior Lecturer, Department of Economics, University of Colombo Prof. Priyanga Dunusinghe\nWe canâ€™t depend on handouts. Instead we should strive to create a developed country with long-term economic growth and sustainable debt repayment capacity. For that, we must take care to create an export-oriented economy.\nToday we are talking about a debt restructuring program. In 2010, a debt restructuring occurred when the world economic crisis emerged. Such things happen even today. 32 percent of countries in the Asian region underwent debt restructuring. The European countries got the concession by 30 percent. Latin American countries received 31 percent. African countries got 47 percent. It is said that we have received 28 percent loan relief so far. But we should not always rely on debt relief. Any country must get rid of its debt to become a developed nation. There should be goals based on three things to get rid of the debt crisis. Countries that achieve such goals will emerge from debt crises.\nForeign direct investment as a percentage of GDP should be at a level of four percent to five percent. Womenâ€™s labour contribution should be at the level of 65 percent to 70 percent. Export of goods and services should be between 65 percent and 70 percent of income. Out of these, our countryâ€™s current export income of goods and services is 21.5 percent. It should be brought closer to 25 percent level and 40 percent level in future.\nWhen it comes to bringing in foreign direct investment or winning new markets, we have a set of goals and programs to achieve. Bribery and corruption should be eliminated. We should reach the level of a developed country in the global anti-corruption index. The ease of doing business index should be brought to the worldâ€™s recognised level. We cannot get out of the crisis just by debt restructuring without following such measures. If we do not act in this way, we will have to take loans from the International Fund and other financial institutions again and again. Ghana, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Greece, which are in debt crisis with us, have done debt restructuring on many occasions to get out of it. However, we should not be prepared to continue following that course. At this time, it is important to learn lessons and work to move forward without falling into the same pit again.\nÂ \nThe post Debt restructuring and Sri Lankaâ€™s future appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-07-06','Opinion','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/9-2.jpg','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/opinion/27346/debt-restructuring-and-sri-lankas-future/'),(175,'Holy and unholy alliances','Creativity in a democracy may be when disparate political parties get together. The clichÃ©, of course, is that politics is the art of the possible.\nIf there are no opposing political groups there is a one party State. There could be one-party systems in fully functioning democracies. If one party consistently keeps winning elections, there is a de facto one party State. But a party system that has a multiplicity of parties that get together and then fall out at the slightest provocation, is called a democracy of hung Parliaments. No, of course, there is no official terminology of that sort. But once upon a time, Sri Lanka, or then Ceylon, did have a democracy of that sort.\nThe fall of the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Government of 1960 was as a result of a defeat in Parliament over the Press Bill. The Federal Party was able to throw its support with Dudley Senanayake and the UNP to form a Government after the 1965 election, with Phillip Gunawardena of the MEP also offering Senanayake a prop under these circumstances.\nSince then, no true creative coalition politics of any significance occurred, even though there was political instability under the stewardship of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga who was unable on occasion to hold onto her coalitionâ€™s Parliamentary majority. In the early 2000s, this resulted in elections, and the formation of a Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, but that Government was short lived too.\nStranger\nWhat would happen if there was an occasion for the creative coalition type of politics that occurred in the 60s were to be re-enacted? Such a situation would be far-fetched, political analysts would say.\nBut yet, that does not prevent us from exploring the eventuality. There have been several theories broached already. There has been talk, for instance, about a grand coalition between the United National Party (UNP), the Pohottuwa (Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna) and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) led by Sajith Premadasa.\nThis is improbable and far-fetched, but having said that at least as possible political reality, Sri Lanka may have never been closer to such an arrangement between the two most powerful conventional (bourgeois?) political parties joining forces to blunt the momentum of the allegedly socialist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).\nTheoretically, there have been similarly improbable political coalitions before. Philip Gunawardenaâ€™s Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) throwing its lot with the so-called bourgeois forces of Dudley Senanayake in 1965 would have been one example. The JVP joining forces with the Chandrika Kumaratunga Government and keeping the latter under probation, literally, was also a good example of improbable politics of convenience. However, a creative coalition of the type some persons are speaking of, between the UNP, SJB and the Pohottuwa would be a political first by far. It is at the point of writing a very remote possibility. However, stranger things have happened in politics â€” at least in other countries â€” that such an eventuality coming to pass can never be completely discounted.\nIn Greenland recently, two fiercely opposed political parties came together to form a coalition Government. A smaller but somewhat formidable political party had formed a coalition Government with one of the main political parties, but the smaller party incurred the displeasure of the two larger parties by taking up the position that only indigenous (Inuit) people should be allowed to vote in any Referendum for independence from Denmark.\nThe electorate â€” or at least the larger parties â€” seemed to be scandalised. This resulted in the two main conventional parties coming together to form a Government (if you need a comparison, think SJB and SLPP or Pohottuwa combining in a coalition.)\nRecently, National Peopleâ€™s Power (NPP) heavyweight Tilvin Silva said this is exactly what is going to happen, because the two main political parties are running scared of being swamped by the JVP or the JVP-led NPP, and would join forces.\nThere is no sign of this happening in reality. But yet, if anything out of the ordinary is going to happen this election season, a JVP-SLPP coalition is far more likely than a JVP-SJB coalition, for instance. An ITAK-JVP coalition or ITAK-SLPP coalition are unlikely eventualities as well.\nCoalition politics could be creative, and at times, strange bedfellows are made when seemingly cherished values and conventions are under threat. This is why the two major parties that are avowed rivals came together to form a Government in Greenland. Greenlanders did not want a â€˜radicalâ€™ party that made Greenland independence exclusively dependent upon Inuit voters to dictate terms.\nMembers of these two large parties saw benefits in being tied to Denmark, a larger nation with greater economic clout than Greenland. When a smaller coalition partner threatened the present orthodoxy, the major parties said enough is enough and promptly joined forces.\nWill the JVPâ€™s apparent front-runner status â€” â€œfront-runnerâ€ according to Tilvin Silva at least â€” result in the SJB, and the SLPP coming together after elections, as opposed to pre-election, in a totally creative coalition?\nTo repeat, as things stand, there is no likelihood of this happening either before or after elections. But analysts believe that todayâ€™s particular arraying of political forces would, if general elections are held first, make way for a hung Parliament.\nIf there is such an outcome, along with the possibility of a formidable JVP in opposition or indeed in Government, would the two major parties close ranks after elections in a political first, and combine their forces?\nFor clarity, for older readers at least, who may find it difficult to keep up with the quicksilver political transformations of our time, this would be like J.R. Jayewardeneâ€™s UNP coming together with Sirimavo Bandarnaikeâ€™s Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to form a Government. Or it would be as if Dudley Senanayake and SWRD Bandaranaike combined forces to create a joint administration after the 1965 election. To say something of that sort would have been unthinkable in those polarised times, is an understatement.\nIf any of these things happened, however, in the 60s or the 70s, it would have signalled a tectonic political shift. The scribes at the then Lake House would have been at a loss to think of what to write, because they were too used to being referred to as the â€˜forces of reactionâ€™ against the progressive forces of Sirimavo Bandaranaike and the Left consisting of the Sama Samajists and the Communists.\nA great many political analysts today feel the JVP factor is overrated. But yet, opinion is divided on that. The conventional political parties represented in the main by the SJB and the Pohottuwa forces and the UNP would likely react to reality, if the JVP does form a Government. It would be to them, as if the JVP had run away with their clothes.\nThat none of this is likely does not stop us journalists from responding to various angles that are being considered by the so-called experts. Some may feel it is exactly the right time for creative coalitions and hung Parliaments because in their view, massive Parliamentary majorities have had overbearing effects on Parliamentary democracy as a force for good.\nNationalist\nHung Parliaments would give room for the cunning to manoeuvre and keep political disruptors at bay, they would feel, but often hung Parliaments do no such thing, and merely foster political instability resulting in chaos and uncertainty. But if a hung Parliament becomes a reality, it would probably be by design rather than purely by accident. In the current conjuncture, it would be useful for certain political forces to seek alliances. Those whom they seek alliances with, however, may not reciprocate.\nBut the latter may change their minds if it somehow becomes clear that improbable alliances would be to their advantage. The Federal Party played this game in the 50 and 60s and their alliance with Dudley Senanayake was seen as a way of staving off Sinhala nationalist forces.\nBut in fact it was Mrs. Bandaranaike who was the expert in strategically using the political ambitions of the then parties of the Left, to her advantage. The Left ideologue N. Shanmugathasan wrote the following about how Mrs. Bandaranaike plotted to break a massive United Left Front (ULF) strike â€˜from within.â€™\nHe describes how Mrs. Bandaranaike summoned the Left leadership for talks: â€˜Even before the beckoning finger of Mrs. Bandaranaike had ceased to move, both N. M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena collided inside Temple Trees through different doors, while poor Peter Keuneman was left at the gate, begging for admission.â€™\nThe long and the short of it was that Mrs. Bandaranaike was able to manoeuvre the founders of the ULF into planting the seeds of its own destruction. As they say, she played it like a fiddle. Could the strategists of today do anything remotely similar when there is great confusion about the future of party politics, and the political allegiances of the day?\nThe post Holy and unholy alliances appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-06-29','Opinion','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/8-2.jpg','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/30/opinion/26697/holy-and-unholy-alliances/'),(176,'Cricket administration needs a complete overhaul â€“ Ali Sabry, PC','After 1996, cricket became a big business :\nCompetent personnel should administer cricket:\nVoting structure in SL cricket problematic:\nSri Lankaâ€™s early exit from the preliminary round of the T20 World Cup has deeply concerned cricket fans nationwide. The team, which triumphed in the T20 World Cup in 2014, managed only one victory against the Netherlands in this tournament. They suffered losses to South Africa and Bangladesh, and their match against Nepal was cancelled due to rain.\nAs the Sri Lankan team, led by Wanindu Hasaranga, returned home empty-handed, a new Cricket Constitution Bill prepared by a six-member committee chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chitrasiri, was presented to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. This committee was formed based on recommendations from a Cabinet sub-committee set up to address the national cricket teamâ€™s recent setbacks and administrative issues.\nLast year, the Cabinet sub-committee, chaired by Foreign Minister Ali Sabri and including Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara, Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, and Public Security Minister Tiran Alas, submitted a 46-page report with 40 recommendations to the Cabinet. Following this, retired Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chitrasiri was appointed in February to draft a new constitution for Sri Lanka Cricket.\nIn a discussion with the Sunday Observer, Foreign Minister Ali Sabri shared his views on the current decline in Sri Lankan cricket, the recommendations of the Cabinet sub-committee, and the Cricket Reform Committee report.\nQ: The Sri Lankan cricket team was thrown out in the preliminary round of this yearâ€™s T20 World Cup, while even teams such as Afghanistan and America advanced to the Super Eight round. What is your opinion?\nA: Today, cricket has fallen like never before in our cricket history. I am talking about Afghanistanâ€™s victory in the Twenty20 World Cup, and I see it as a reflection of the condition of our cricket before 1996. Afghanistan focused solely on the game and the country, much like the cricket administration in our country at that time. Some individuals genuinely loved the game and dedicated their time and money to cricket: Ana Punchihewa, Raja Mahendran, Daham Wimalasena, N.M. Perera, and Gamini Dissanayake. They worked with great enthusiasm, seeking no personal favours or privileges.\nHowever, after 1996, cricket became a big business. An influx of money came in, with sponsorships and television broadcasting rights. This shift led to a situation where, instead of a passion for cricket, the desire to gain benefits and fame from it took over. A few individuals, with no real fame, are now in control. Often, their decisions do not reflect the wisdom expected. That is why we say our cricket administration needs a complete overhaul.\nQ: The Cricket Reforms Committee was appointed according to the report given by the Cabinet sub-committee chaired by the President to look into the cricket crisis. What has been your committeeâ€™s experience looking into the decline in cricket?\nA: Before calling the Cricket Reforms Committee report, we gained significant experience while collecting facts for the report we completed. We have identified major weaknesses in cricket administration. Competent individuals should administer cricket, and this has two parts. One is the administration of the cricket institute, and the other is the technical aspect of cricket, which can be managed by cricket players and coaches.\nHowever, managing an organisation is akin to managing a company. How will it be audited? How will the procurement process be conducted? How will information be obtained? It requires talented individuals. For instance, a person who worked in a big company has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Therefore, we believe a significant change in administration is necessary, and we have stated this in our report.\nQ: What are the weaknesses of the Sri Lankan cricket industry identified by the Cabinet sub-committee?\nA: We discussed with the cricket players, and one key issue they highlighted is the low quality of our pitches. They said that the ball â€˜cutsâ€™ well on these pitches, but when they go to international tournaments such as the 2023 ODI World Cup, they struggle from the very first ball because the pitches differ.\nThis is a significant problem. Despite this, our cricket administration is investing about one and a half to two billion rupees in the Dambulla stadium to install lights for day-night matches, which havenâ€™t been played there in many years. This investment seems misplaced. Recently, I heard that Rs. 52 million worth of live screens were purchased and given to those who didnâ€™t request them. This reflects a lack of transparency in spending, which, if not addressed, could lead to a further decline in our cricket standards.\nMoreover, the voting structure in Sri Lanka Cricket is problematic. Despite having a population of 22 million, there are 147 votes in the cricket office election compared to countries such as India, Australia, and England, which have far fewer votes. This discrepancy allows resources to be used primarily to win these votes rather than for cricket development. This system discourages talented individuals from participating.\nFor example, Muralidaran said that while he could win votes from the Colombo district, he wouldnâ€™t receive any from the cricket board. This indicates that a separate group is maintaining power, which must change. Significant investment is needed in infrastructure, new pitches, and technical knowledge. Supporting young players transitioning from school is also crucial to ensure they stay in the sport.\nQ: What are the proposals made by the Cabinet Sub-Committee to develop Sri Lanka Cricket?\nA: In my report, I noted that both coaches and players point out each otherâ€™s shortcomings, leading to a lack of harmony. Conversely, our womenâ€™s cricket team, which is very united and respectful towards coach Rumesh Ratnayake, is performing well. This unity and respect contribute to their success. The local cricket structure needs change, as combining the â€˜Aâ€™ and â€˜Bâ€™ sections in tournaments has lowered the standard.\nWe recommend revisiting the report by Aravinda de Silva, Muttiah Muralitharan, Kumar Sangakkara, and Mahela Jayawardene on developing cricket. Their insights are valuable, especially as they coach IPL teams. We suggested gathering a group to review and implement this report. Changes should ensure that cricket administration isnâ€™t dominated by a few individuals who exploit resources for personal gain.\nQ: What are the recommendations made in addition to the suggestions?\nA: Our recommendations include several points, highlighting three Auditor General reports since 2018. These reports state that $100,000 being transferred from Sri Lanka Cricket to an American account, which needs investigation. We also proposed drafting a new constitution through the Cricket Reforms Committee, which should be enacted into law via Parliament. This would limit the number of votes in the cricket body and restrict the cricket committee to 18 members, selected from different fields and sports clubs. These members should include former cricketers, ensuring a balance. A CEO should manage day-to-day operations, selected based on talent through advertisements, similar to practices in Australia and India. Implementing these measures would provide a solid foundation for our cricket administration.\nQ: How long will it take to implement the reports of the Cabinet Sub-Committee and the Cricket Reforms Committee?\nA: This falls under the Minister of Sports, responsible for implementation. Given that the committee included the Attorney Generalâ€™s and Legislation Department members, it shouldnâ€™t take long. If we work collaboratively, the new law could be passed within three weeks to two months after it is gazetted. We can provide a report and recommendations to the Sports Secretary, but the implementation must be monitored.\nQ: Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is an organisation dealing with the International Cricket Council (ICC). Are they saying that it is not a Government-owned institution?\nA: That notion is incorrect. Cricket is a public institution, not a private company created by private investment. It is a Government institution since government schools and their children played cricket, which led to ICC membership. Therefore, cricket belongs to the people of Sri Lanka and should be accountable to them. The current administration has misused resources as personal property, which must be rectified. Cricketâ€™s success should be measured by its inspiration and pride to Sri Lanka, not just the cricket boardâ€™s budget or the number of tournaments held.\nQ: Will the International Cricket Council influence the Governmentâ€™s intervention in the cricket body?\nA: This process cannot be hindered by fear of ICC intervention. The Lodha Committee of India and South Africa, where Government decisions impacted cricket administration, show that such changes are possible. The Prime Minister of Pakistan appoints the Cricket President, but we suggest a clear, independent selection process. A selection committee of independent individuals should choose candidates for the cricket body, ensuring balance and integrity. The selected CEO would handle day-to-day administration, while the committee focuses on policy decisions. This structure, akin to a companyâ€™s management, would address the current issues in Sri Lanka Cricketâ€™s administration.\nThe post Cricket administration needs a complete overhaul â€“ Ali Sabry, PC appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-07-06','Opinion','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4-2.jpg','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/07/07/opinion/27312/cricket-administration-needs-a-complete-overhaul-ali-sabry-pc/'),(177,'Ranilâ€™s poster, address to the nation and candidacy at Presidential polls','It seems that some people have already forgotten the pressure and difficulties faced by the people when Sri Lanka had gone through the worst ever economic crisis just two years ago. Some people have hopes to defeat their strongest opponent and gain victory by spreading falsehoods, hatred and malice. Therefore, these days, many reports, statements and posts related to politics on social media are published aiming at distorting the real ground situation. It seems that they think that the political ideologies of the country should be determined through that.\nThe unveiling of the poster titled Aranchiya Subhai (Await! Good news) can be described as an event that gives an understanding of how the media should be handled in such a situation. Some media activists say that this poster has attracted more people than the famous poster Mekaudaâ€¦ Monawada Karanne (Who is this, what is he doing). The poster â€œWho is this and what is he doingâ€ was published only as a poster in those pre-Internet days while the Aranchiya Subhai poster has become a poster as well as a post that has been repeatedly posted and shared many times on social media networks.\nToday, that poster has become one of the most used among many people. Aranchiya Subhai is now being used a lot on social media when referring to anything new. Now it is being used in some advertisements and products as well. This is the best example to show how a creative way was used to announce the successful completion of the countryâ€™s debt restructuring. It has immediately gained the attention of the entire country.\nGood news\nIt was recently shown that some people have forgotten about the harsh experiences that they faced during the economic crisis, but for a large number of people, those bitter memories will not fade away. Knowing that the country is getting out of bankruptcy, the people welcomed the good news by lighting firecrackers. I think that the light that was lit from all directions of the country that day was a symbol of the happiness of the people.\nAt the same time, President Ranil Wickremesingheâ€™s speech to the nation on June 26 seems to have provided an opportunity for the people to have confidence in the countryâ€™s future. It seems that the speech created a different atmosphere for the people who think that they are in a country where they cannot fulfil their dreams, as well as for the people who think that they cannot deal with the future with confidence. In his speech, President Wickremesinghe said that an atmosphere has now been created where the country can escape from bankruptcy and fulfil the expectations of the countryâ€™s youth. While announcing the successful completion of the countryâ€™s debt restructuring, the President also let the public know that he is contesting the forthcoming Presidential Election (PE). Explaining the efforts that he has taken in rebuilding the country and its economy in his address to the nation he said, â€œThey are walking all over Sri Lanka asking for power. They go to schools and ask for power. They are travelling around the world and asking for power and working day and night for power.â€\nâ€œI work day and night for the country, walking all over Sri Lanka and fulfilling the needs of the people and launching programs to strengthen the economy. I am going around the world and working to get international support to develop our countryâ€.\nThen he let the people know that he would run for the PE, leaving the responsibility of deciding on it to the people of this country.\nâ€œWill you join me, who has taken the country forward by understanding the problem from the beginning and giving practical solutions to those issues and also who has shown results or join the groups that still do not understand the countryâ€™s problems and groping in the dark but striving hard for power?â€, he said.\nWhen the other Presidential candidates announced their candidacy and walked all over the country asking for power, President Wickremesinghe said he had taken all efforts to get the country out of darkness and there was a room for people to have a choice between him and them. Until that dayâ€™s indication, President Wickremesinghe had not announced whether he would contest the Presidential Election. He was not ready to announce his candidacy for the PE or start campaigning for it saying as there was enough time for it. In a marathon, there is no advantage for a runner to run at his maximum speed from the very beginning. His strategy seems to have been to exert maximum energy when he is close to the end line of the race while other candidates, who run fast from the start, seem exhausted before the final lap of the race.\nSeasoned politician\nPresident Wickremesinghe, who is a matured and seasoned politician, has an excellent knowledge and experience on elections, including PEs, how the election campaigns should be conducted, and measures to be taken while having experience of winning as well as losing elections. It seems as if he started his Presidential campaign with one poster that is sweeping the entire country.\nAfter releasing the Aranchiya Subhai poster and the Presidentâ€™s address to the nation, no one is now saying that he will not contest the PE. All the claims made by some that he will not contest the PE have now come to an end. He has been able to suppress the campaigns of all other parties with one poster in a sudden and surprising move and create a situation where all the campaigns of others are shaped according to his own campaign.\nDuring those days, other Presidential candidates were vociferous claiming that President Wickremesinghe was going to make a ruse by addressing the nation on June 26. Those parties declared that what he was going to say about debt restructuring is a false propaganda campaign that is going to be started with the aim of deceiving the people. Nevertheless, the real situation was confirmed by the statements of foreign diplomats as well as foreign countries and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Senior Mission Chief in Sri Lanka Peter Breuer before and after the Presidentâ€™s statement.\nUS Ambassador Julie J. Chung has congratulated Sri Lanka on the outcome of the debt restructuring process. India has sent a detailed greeting and expressed that it will continue to support Sri Lanka in the same way it supported Sri Lanka during the economic crisis and appreciated the successful completion of the debt restructuring. At the same time, Japan had also issued a statement and IMF Senior Mission Chief Breuer issued a statement that the countryâ€™s economy has started a successful journey due to Sri Lanka being able to implement debt restructuring at a successful level. Due to such strong statements, it became clear that it is not the kind of deception that the Opposition claims.\nWhat I see as the most important thing is to observe the changes in the PE race after President Wickremesinghe indicated his candidacy and it clearly shows that there are three prominent candidates running for the PE. One change is the way in which the other two parties reacted with panic and confusion after the indication of candidacy by President Wickremesinghe. I think that people see how a big propaganda campaign was launched against President Wickremesingheâ€™s poster and address to the nation, forgetting all other matters.\nThe other is to observe how the politics of the country has completely turned upside down in a sudden move and the course of politics has undergone a great change. Mostly, it is reflected in relation to social media. It would appear that the campaigns of both the other major candidates, which were run with great enthusiasm up to now, have suffered a major setback. The liveliness of their statements made in platforms or other occasions have now become lifeless and lacklustre.\nThe post Ranilâ€™s poster, address to the nation and candidacy at Presidential polls appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-06-29','Opinion','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/9-2-300x86.jpg','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/30/opinion/26704/ranils-poster-address-to-the-nation-and-candidacy-at-presidential-polls/'),(178,'IMF process cannot be halted or altered','This article is compiled from an interview with Prof. Priyanga Dunusinghe of the Faculty of Economics, University of Colombo.\nAs announced by President Ranil Wickremesinghe during his recent address to the nation, Sri Lanka has signed the agreement to the tune of US$ 10.08 billion for bilateral debt restructuring. One agreement has been signed with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) of the Paris Club and the other with China. This will give the country extra time to repay the debt.\nAlso, a debt repayment grace period is available through restructuring. According to the Presidentâ€™s announcement, through debt restructuring, Sri Lankaâ€™s debt load, i.e. nine percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) required in relation to repayments, is expected. Efforts will be made to reduce it from nine to 4.5 percent in relation to the 2027-2032 period. Also the gross financial requirement has been reduced by 13 percent in relation to these periods, i.e. in relation to 2027 to 2032 period. These debt restructurings are expected to achieve these goals related to debt sustainability.\nRestructuring of bilateral debt is very important and it can be considered a victory. It can be analysed on several points. The first point is that Sri Lankaâ€™s name was seriously tarnished internationally with the debt default. The reason for that serious scar is because Sri Lanka has never defaulted on debt in its history before 2022.\nExporters, importers and investors faced various problems and difficulties. Through the restructuring of this debt, we can expect to rebuild the image as well as improve the situation. Secondly, especially with debt restructuring, all foreign projects that were currently being implemented with the assistance of bilateral creditors were suspended due to loan defaults.\nIn practice, if a certain type of country defaults on its debt, all development projects are put on pause. The same situation happened in Sri Lanka. The Central Expressway, the BIA expansion project and various other projects were stalled. With the completion of the debt restructuring, the development projects are expected to resume very soon as per the agreements. Even creditor nations are expecting these development schemes to resume as soon as the debt restructuring is done.\nEconomic recovery\nA positive impact on the economic development and a positive impact on security can be expected in starting the development projects that had been halted along the way. To create a good economic outlook, to create credibility for foreign and local investors, for the entire people, some credibility will be created in the gradual occurrence of economic recovery. The chances of a country becoming nationally bankrupt and facing various shocks may increase in the future. In the history of the world, especially when the economy of Latin American countries recovered, there have been external shocks.\nFor example, if an epidemic such as the current bird flu spreads, the tourism industry around the world may collapse. Foreign currencies may collapse and lead to an economic crisis again. In the event of such an economic crisis, if we did not have the IMF, no other country would be able to help us. Due to debt restructuring, if we face any kind of shock now, we will be able to get some assistance in such a case. There was great uncertainty and challenge in the delay in not restructuring the debt.\nDebt restructuring has led to a reduction in exposure to risk and the possibility of a repeat economic crisis. Restructuring with bilateral creditors is mandatory. It is also necessary to ink agreements with the International Sovereign Bond (ISB) holders very soon. This will help complete the debt restructuring process to meet IMF conditions. The end result is that the positive situation needed to reset the economy is created.\nThe money from this restructuring will have to be paid by the year 2028. We should prepare for that. To ensure loan payments, we need to increase export earnings. In the coming period, our economy will have to bear a lesser burden than it has before. As a country we are entitled to a grace period to repay the debt. Giving that extra time means paying a less amount as a premium. We need to create the ability to repay the debt. Gradually we will be able to pay the debt through economic development. Debt sustainability is evident in the study.\nWe need to push our economy into the export sector as much as possible. Even if our existing economy is maintained to this extent and the economic growth is maintained at four to five percent, we will surely get the ability to pay the debt. As the loan instalment has been reduced, it is possible to pay the loan more than the requirement.\nTo maintain a continuous level of economic growth, necessary measures to promote exports should be expanded to promote local investments. We are given room to breathe. There we should breathe properly and all parties should work to build the countryâ€™s economy. As a country, we will not make a debt payment during that period, including the year 2028; a moratorium â€“ a temporary period that allows the lender to stop making payments for a specified period of time. There it works through several methods.\nThere are some cases where the loan is unpaid and interest is not paid. There are also cases where the portion of the loan is paid and the interest is paid. Although it is not clear what has been given here, the debt burden of this country will decrease. More importantly, debt repayment has been eased from nine percent to 4.5 percent of GDP with debt-related restructuring.\nOf the US$ 14 billion commercial loans, there is another US$ 12 billion. Negotiations are ongoing with respect to the bond holders. In debt restructuring, the debt of ISB holders is usually restructured after the debt from bilateral sources is restructured. Once bilateral debts are restructured, the debt restructuring process of bondholders can be completed easily. Therefore, we must promote the export sector and the foreign investment sector.\nThe Governmentâ€™s targets are set out in the Economic Transformation Act. We need to implement development programs and policies to increase exports of goods and services to 25 percent of the GDP in 2025 and gradually to 40 percent in 2030, and to bring foreign investments to a level of five percent as a percentage of the GDP. We should use this relief given to us to positively create a revival in the economy. Especially exports should be promoted. Without that, we cannot expect the countryâ€™s economy to grow.\nBy 2025, the export of goods and services as a percentage of the GDP is to grow to 25 percent and it is basically intended to grow to 40 percent by 2030. The Government has already prepared plans towards an export-oriented economy. It is a constructive process. Changes are taking place in a related structure within the Governmentâ€™s development program to promote foreign investments and market Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Accordingly, organisations such as the Enterprise Sri Lanka have been established and efforts are being made to promote foreign investment.\nExport development\nThe Government hopes to develop identified export promotion sectors to promote the effectiveness of the Bureau to establish an agency for international trade. It is necessary not only to initiate but also to operate all these institutions. Any Government that comes to power in the future should pay attention to this matter. Export development should be done urgently. The matters of foreign investment promotion and trade must be followed. For that, the foundation must be prepared by now.\nWith the IMF today we have reached financial stabilisation and debt restructuring has started. In the future, many deep reforms will have to be done. We must continue these reforms. If adverse decisions are taken for the sake of gaining political power, if there is opposition to these reforms, it is very clear what the final result of that opposition will be. This ongoing economic reform may be disrupted. For example, if the leadership of a different political party is chosen, the progress of economic reforms may be hindered. It is a big challenge and it will cause the biggest obstacle to the economic stability of Sri Lanka in the future.\nCare should be taken to ensure that these reforms are not affected by any upcoming political changes. These essential economic reforms should be implemented in the country, regardless of which political parties gain power. We can no longer go to these welfarist economic reforms. This economy cannot be built on subsidies. All political parties should understand this.\nIn the future, welfarist populist political promises cannot be implemented. Even though they make promises to get into power, as a country, we should think clearly and realistically and make short-term painful decisions that benefit the country in the long run. The leadership should also not hesitate to take painful decisions.\nIf there is any hope to develop the country, welfare economic reforms cannot continue. In the future, we must overthrow the system of maintaining a group of people who benefit from the tax money of hardworking citizens. We need to get out of the subsidy mentality. Instead of maintaining a group who live on welfare we should create an environment that benefits those who do honest labour.\nThere are politicians who use the economy for political gains by perpetuating the welfare system as means of gaining power. If we build a society of hardworking citizens, this country will be able to develop again. If not, we may end up in a crisis again and again. This is a clear victory, and to sustain that victory, the people must work hard and line up to build the country.\nTranslated by Jonathan Frank\nThe post IMF process cannot be halted or altered appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-06-29','Opinion',NULL,'https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/30/opinion/26708/imf-process-cannot-be-halted-or-altered/'),(179,'IMF pact: Major changes not possible â€“ Ali Sabry, PC','Govt winning trust of international community:\nRCEP membership, more Free Trade pacts mulled :\nElections will be held on time:\nIn an exclusive interview with the Sunday Observer, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Presidentâ€™s Counsel Ali Sabry shares insights into Sri Lankaâ€™s evolving diplomatic relations, economic strategies, and internal challenges. Minister Sabri discusses the Governmentâ€™s proactive engagement with the Muslim world, pivotal bilateral relations with India, efforts to avoid geopolitical entanglements, and the countryâ€™s participation in regional economic partnerships.\nQ: As the Foreign Minister, do you think the Government and the President are winning the trust of the Muslim world by expressing regret over Muslim burials and also the stand on the Gaza War?\nA: Yes, I believe so. Since President Wickremesinghe took office, we have adopted a very proactive approach to engaging with the Muslim world. I have been travelling extensively, and Foreign Ministers from that region have also been visiting Sri Lanka frequently.\nWe have taken principled stands on the Gaza matter, both at the UN and elsewhere, which has earned us significant respect in the international Muslim community. Recently, I met the Foreign Minister of Palestine, who expressed profound gratitude for our consistent position.\nRegarding the burials, the decision to prohibit them at that time was a grave mistake. Unfortunately, it happened, but all we can do now is express our regret and apologise to the Muslims and the affected families. It wasnâ€™t only Muslims who were impacted; some Buddhists who wished to bury their loved ones were also denied. To prevent such issues in the future, we are introducing a new law that will grant people the right to choose either burial or cremation, unless the WHO advises otherwise for specific reasons.\nOverall, internationally, we are gaining the trust of the Muslim community. As for the Muslim community in Sri Lanka, whether we are winning their trust remains to be seen. However, they do appreciate the Presidentâ€™s multi-ethnic approach, where he treats all Sri Lankans as equals and does not single out any particular segment.\nQ: It is significant that Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankarâ€™s first foreign visit was to Sri Lanka after being sworn in. What were the significant highlights of this visit?\nA: There were several highlights of Dr. Jaishankarâ€™s visit. The most notable was the support extended by India during Sri Lankaâ€™s economic crisis. The close to four billion dollars in credit lines provided by India was crucial; without this support, Sri Lankaâ€™s economy could have collapsed beyond repair. This visit reaffirmed Indiaâ€™s continuous support for Sri Lanka and enhanced our business partnerships.\nWe reviewed numerous joint projects, including a dedicated Free Trade Zone in Trincomalee and collaboration on educational initiatives with the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIT) in Chennai. We also discussed potential opportunities in the renewable energy sector.\nThe visit emphasized two key points: first, our desire to strengthen the economic partnership between our countries; and second, the significance of Dr. Jaishankar choosing Sri Lanka for his first official visit as External Affairs Minister during this period. This underscores the importance India places on its relationship with Sri Lanka, which is very gratifying for us. We discussed the possibility of a high-level visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the near future.\nQ: What is the Government doing to avoid getting entangled in any geopolitical conflicts in the Indian Ocean Region, especially through its IORA Chairmanship?\nA: We have made it very clear that we are not aligned with any particular camp. We are an independent country and will continue to uphold this stance. Our basic principle and vision are â€œfriendship with all and enmity to none.â€ We are reaching out to everyone globally.\nIt is very important for us to avoid tensions or superpower rivalries at our doorstep, whether in the Indian Ocean or in our airspace. To achieve this, we have explicitly said that we are not interested in providing military bases for any country. However, we are open to conducting business with everyone. By consistently taking issue-based positions, we believe we have earned the support of the international community.\nQ: With SAARC almost dormant, is Sri Lanka pivoting more towards BIMSTEC and Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA)?\nA: IORA is indeed very active, especially under our chairmanship. We have been undertaking numerous projects almost every month, and this has been very effective. Last year, we hosted the IORA Ministersâ€™ Meeting and the IORA Day celebration. We also conducted sectoral dialogues on maritime security and cruise tourism. Just last week, we held a Business Council meeting in Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Colombo Chamber of Commerce. We are continuously working towards strengthening our engagement with IORA.\nRegarding SAARC, it is in a challenging situation due to well-known reasons. While we are keen to see SAARC become more active, it remains in a difficult position. Recently, the SAARC Director General visited Sri Lanka for discussions, and there is a significant amount of work happening at the official level. However, it has yet to progress to the Foreign Minister or summit levels. Until our major neighbours, India and Pakistan, resolve their differences, it may take longer than anticipated for SAARC to become fully operational again. This situation represents a lost opportunity for all countries in the region.\nQ: What is the progress with regard to joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and having more Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with countries in the region?\nA: The idea behind joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and securing more FTAs is essentially twofold. Firstly, no one is going to invest solely based on the Sri Lankan market, which comprises just 22 million people â€“ not a huge market for attracting significant investment.\nTo address this, we aim to position Sri Lanka as a regional hub, serving a larger market. We can achieve this by establishing FTAs, thereby creating an artificially larger market that is ten or even 100 times bigger than our own. This strategy has been successful for countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. By following this approach, we can attract foreign capital and investment, which is crucial for our economic growth, along with technology transfer.\nRegarding the RCEP, we have applied for membership and are following the set criteria and procedures. We anticipate visits from the Foreign Ministers of Malaysia and Indonesia in August, and we will continue our discussions with them. We are very keen on this.\nIn terms of FTAs, we have made significant progress. We have signed FTAs with Bangladesh and Thailand and are currently negotiating with Malaysia, Indonesia, China, and India for more comprehensive agreements. It is essential to approach this carefully to avoid overexposing our market and to ensure that any agreement results in a win-win situation for all parties involved.\nQ: At a diplomatic level, what is the level of success with talks on debt structuring with creditor countries and International Sovereign Bond (ISB) holders?\nA: Sri Lanka has reached the final agreement on debt restructuring between Sri Lanka and the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) on the sidelines of the Paris Forum 2024 in Paris, France. This will facilitate the restructuring of our debt with foreign creditor countries.\nWith this agreement, instead of suspending payments, we will secure a postponement of payments and resume paying interest and other dues. This is a significant development for Sri Lanka.\nSri Lanka is on track to be one of the fastest countries to emerge from bankruptcy. For instance, Greece, despite being a European Union (EU) country, took about 11 years to come out of bankruptcy. If we can achieve this faster, it will be a remarkable accomplishment for us.\nQ: Several Western countries are still alleging that Sri Lanka engaged in genocide while seemingly ignoring Israelâ€™s actions in the Gaza War. What is your view on this?\nA: The situation can largely be attributed to domestic politics in many Western capitals, where pockets of diaspora votes exert pressure on their MPs, who in turn influence their Governments or ruling parties. This phenomenon is likely to persist for some time.\nWe in Sri Lanka must continue to uphold internal accountability mechanisms. However, the double standards of the West are very evident. The way they address different conflicts, whether in Ukraine or Gaza, is clear for all to see.\nWho provides the diplomatic cover, arms, and ammunition that enable the slaughter of innocent, unarmed civilians, particularly women and children, in Gaza? The death toll there has now exceeded 37,000, yet there is no tangible action being taken. Every time the Security Council or UN proposes a resolution, it is often vetoed or blocked.\nThis double standard is particularly difficult to understand when it comes to Sri Lanka. According to our Constitution, we treat all our people as equals. In any conflict, there will unfortunately be collateral damage, but we fought not against a minority group but against terrorism, and we united our people.\nWe provided food and immunity to those affected by the conflict, and we have released 94 percent of the land occupied during the height of the war. Today, you can see students from previously war-torn areas such as Mullativu and Kilinochchi entering medical faculties, which demonstrates that Sri Lanka treats all its people with respect and dignity.\nQ: Can the Presidentâ€™s term be extended by a referendum or by other legal provisions? What is your view?\nA: Technically, extending the Presidentâ€™s term requires amending the Constitution with a two-thirds majority in Parliament, followed by a referendum.\nI donâ€™t think itâ€™s feasible, and even if it were, it shouldnâ€™t be done. The people must endorse and give the power to carry out reforms to whoever is in office. I believe the President has done enough to go before the people and lay a strong claim for another term, given the significant improvements from two years ago to today.\nPeople may express various personal opinions, but the President himself and the Government are not interested in postponing any elections, particularly the Presidential Election (PE). It will be held as per the Constitution.\nQ: Who will you be supporting at the PE and would you back a Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) candidate if it were a choice between President Wickremesinghe and SLPP?\nA: We have to wait and see how things unfold. Personally, I feel that President Ranil deserves another term for the betterment of the country. These economic reforms are challenging and require foresight and knowledge to implement effectively. I do not see anyone else who could accomplish what he has done.\nInternationally, he has gained many supporters and admirers in multilateral organisations such as the UN, World Bank, and IMF. He has also garnered support from the international community, including both Eastern and Western countries. I believe it would be beneficial for the country if he could remain in power for another term.\nQ: Many have perceived the Presidentâ€™s recent statements on the Supreme Court as a violation of the independence of the Judiciary. What do you think of this?\nA: Supreme Court judgments, like those of any other body, are open to legal criticism. The President has exercised this right. However, it is crucial that all branches of Government â€“ the Judiciary, Executive, and Legislatureâ€”respect their boundaries and roles.\nIntellectual criticism of judgments is normal and happens daily. Beyond that, we should observe and ensure that all branches maintain their independence and integrity.\nQ: There have been remarks made by the Opposition parties about renegotiating the deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Could you elaborate on whether it is possible to renegotiate or what possible amendments can be made?\nA: While discussions with the IMF are always possible, fundamentally changing the scope of the agreement is not feasible. The parameters, such as the percentage of GDP that should be taxed and the proportion allocated for foreign loan repayment, must be adhered to by any administration.\nWhile the approach to achieving these targets can be negotiated, major changes to the IMF agreement itself are unlikely. Such discussions by Opposition parties are often more about election rhetoric than practical policy changes.\nPic by Dushmantha Mayadunne\nThe post IMF pact: Major changes not possible â€“ Ali Sabry, PC appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-06-29','Opinion','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/4-2-1.jpg','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/30/opinion/26679/imf-pact-major-changes-not-possible-ali-sabry-pc/'),(180,'Corruption is a power trip','Corruption is about ego and buying influence the way molestation or rape is mostly a power trip thatâ€™s not about sexual gratification. The corrupt do not know what to do with their money. They are not fleecing the public because they are trying hard to send their children to school, or making just enough to pay the house rent.\nMostly, the corrupt are being corrupt because they can be. They have no scruples and are ego driven and enjoy buying the influence they buy, because they are corruptand it comes as second nature.\nThis corruption can be seen time and again in different guises. Those who defended the same indefensible situation several times over, are corrupt, just because the system can be abused. They are brazen.\nbrickbats\nThere are those who said theyâ€™d retire from politics who are now back in the arena. These people are thick. They said theyâ€™d be out of the political arena and enjoyed subsequent time out in the wilderness, while others who had lost faced the brickbats. Now that there is a chance that they can wheedle their way back to power, those who said they are retiring from politics are at it again.\nSo corruption is seen to be brazen, and the culmination of the rat race of needless competition. Those who are corrupt think they are competing in the best way, buying influence, and being the men in the middle who manipulate the system at will. Somebody had recently asked the question, but what do they do with their money? Do they do something good at the very least and in fact do something vaguely positive with their ill-gotten gains, such as ensure that they have a great garden or something they could aesthetically admire?\nNo. Of course the corrupt buy flashy vehicles as thatâ€™s their petty way of showing that they are top of the pops, as it is said in common parlance. But oftentimes they have earned much more money through corrupt activities than could be spent on a couple of glitzy vehicles that scream conspicuous consumption.\nWhat do they do with all that money? Do they try to enhance the quality of their lives with it, or be more aesthetic in a non ostentatious and appreciably muted way?\nNo they donâ€™t. Mostly the corrupt merely stash their ill-gotten lucre because thatâ€™s a power trip in and of itself. They could be smug that they have hoodwinked and squirreled away a great deal of loot, and that there are a whole heap of gullible people out there who they have made absolute fools of.\nThat power trip is enough for the corrupt. Theyâ€™d keep some money, or more accurately theyâ€™d keep most of the stash away from prying eyes. With the rest, they try to buy up influence.\nThe corrupt think they can pay and get something done even if their cause is not legitimate. Sometimes in this society it takes money to get something done, even when whatâ€™s being sought is entirely legitimate.\nBut the corrupt seek to buy influence to peddle ideas and positions that are far from legitimate. Society is ego driven and fiercely competitive by nature in these times. That has been obvious if people have had a minimum of experience doing what is supposed to be acceptable in society, such as going to school and opting for a regular life.\nChasing fame and money are all ego-driven pursuits. But itâ€™s what the school system encourages unfortunately from day one. Those who seek to excel by fair means or foul are extolled. Others are cast by the wayside as losers.\nSo, some burn the midnight oil and get ahead in many competitive pursuits such as exams. But they have one goal in mind. It is that which is ego driven i.e of making as much money as possible and flaunting it, complemented by the pursuance of fame and glory so called.\nItâ€™s small wonder then that the corrupt see corruption as a shortcut to those types of goals in a society thatâ€™s already wedded to these false and ego-driven values.\nThe corrupt seek to purchase and influence those others who have burnt the midnight oil, because they feel they have a right to laugh at them too. The latter have pursued power and glory through legitimate means such as passing exams. But nevertheless they too are creatures of the same rat race.\nThe corrupt feel thatâ€™s fine then, because they can cock a snook at those who passed examinations and sought a more conventional route to money and glory, if all are in the same game. By now the most oblivious reader would also probably get the drift.\nThe corrupt justify themselves because they think they are doing what society wants them to do, which is to cover themselves in cash and be conspicuous. Thatâ€™s what after all, society seems to reward and deify.\nThatâ€™s why there seems to be so much brazen corruption within our system. Itâ€™s why politicians of various stripes come before the public and make the most preposterous claims even though the public knows none of it is true.\nmiscalculations\nBut the corrupt know that at the end of the day the truth can suffer an inglorious demise. They know that money can buy influence, evenamong voters.\nThough sometimes they may make certain miscalculations, the corrupt feel the influence they have purchased is enough to help them live another day even if things go wrong at the current conjuncture. As they say, â€œthose who fight and run away, live to run another day.â€ Said in jest, but words of wisdom, no doubt â€¦\nIn this system of influence peddling, it is the truly brave who could be incorruptible, and yet prevail. The corrupt would try to outmanoeuvre such people at every turn, but the results of corruption often speak for themselves and thatâ€™s where the palpably venal eventually get caught out.\nBut by the time they are caught out the facts have become obfuscated. It is the system that has grown legs of its own, because itâ€™s the core values of that system that are warped.\nThe system glorifies money and power, or money and glory or fame as the case may be, and hence it is not surprising that those values would be reflected in the exterior political structure. Itâ€™s a structure that perpetuates corrupt means at the expense of nobler pursuits such as feeding people, and providing them with a living wage.\nHonest men are scapegoated to pay for the sins of the more powerful. This is a trend that is seen in many areas of national endeavour. Sporting debacles come to mind.\nThe structure behind a great many debacles remains out of view of the pubic eye, and some pawns and minions may be sacrificed or trotted out to take the hit when debacles occur. But there are many out there who are willing to defend the structure, because corruption of course, and the exchange of filthy lucre, plays a huge part in that process.The several near collapses our national airline faced on many occasions in the past, may be a case in point.\nThose who are corrupt and seek to buy influence may of course never quite accomplish their ends because their ends are driven by unalloyed greed. Those who stash money as an end in itself also like to retain influence and power as an end in itself.\nThat becomes an impossible proposition however, because no amount of money can buy influence endlessly, and so the cycle repeats. Those consumed by greed would one day be hoist by their own petard, and time and again history has taught the avaricious that single lesson to no avail.\nBut itâ€™s the damage that the corrupt do that destroys lives and brings misery to people who were pawns in a bigger game played at a level they have no access to, and had no part in.\nIn multiple areas of pubic endeavour, however, itâ€™s the public that has been duped ,which means a part of the public so duped has to bear the consequences of their gullibility. But most of the public are sooner or later wiser to the truth. Itâ€™s just that they have no way of overcoming the stench of corruption that engulfs them.\nThey see no other way except to shrug their shoulders and move on. But seeing corruption for what it is may be a major victory by itself. The corrupt who swim against that tide of realisation, often know their game would be up, before they realise the folly of their ways.\nThe post Corruption is a power trip appeared first on Sunday Observer.','2024-06-22','Opinion','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tag-SO-BY-RajpalA.jpg','https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2024/06/23/opinion/26212/corruption-is-a-power-trip/'),(181,'Economic growth imminent with price reduction of goods','T oday, a drastic change can be seen in many sectors when compared to those days during the Aragalaya. The socio-economic crisis triggered due to the Easter- Sunday attack in 2019 and also due to Covid-19 pandemic, many things happened in the country throughout that period until the end of the Aragalaya. Mostly those badly affected the countryâ€™s culture had taken place. Paying the last respect to loved ones is an usual practice in our society but due to the Covid-19 pandemic this practice has been changed and very few people attended weddings and funerals in fear of the epidemic. But now it has been changed as people participate in those functions freely.\nThat situation has been changed gradually with no more queues and restrictions for getting essential goods for peopleâ€™s day-to-day lives. Except for vehicle imports, shortages in some of the goods are no more.\nI think many people remember how prices of goods skyrocketed during those days and Sri Lanka was among the five countries with the highest inflation rate in the world. There was also a situation where the dollar value was changing rapidly. Initially, the dollar value was at Rs. 225 but due to the unprecedented economic crisis it depreciated making a rapid increase in the dollar value. This resulted in the dollar exchange in the blackmarket even at a higher rate and it rose upto Rs.470. At the same time, fuel prices and bank loan interest rates also increased causing a huge increase in prices of all commodities.\nRising commodity prices\nIn economics, the reasons for rising commodity prices and increasing inflation have been explained. The rise in prices is largely due to increased demand. However, apart from that, inflation can also increase due to various other reasons. It seems that economic reasons as well as non-economic reasons have influenced the rise in prices of goods and services in Sri Lanka during those days. The prices of commodities rose dramatically and taking advantage of the situation, the producers as well as the traders created an artificial price hike in all goods.\nIt is normal for the price of milk powder to rise when the rupee depreciates and the dollar appreciates but there was an unusual hike in milk powder prices. Initially, the price of a 400 gram packet of locally produced Highland milk powder was Rs 290, while the price of a 400 gram packet of imported Anchor milk powder was Rs 370. However, under that scenario the price of a packet of Highland milk powder went up to Rs.1,150 and the price of a packet of Anchor milk powder went up to Rs. 1,050 due to increase in the dollar value. However, it is unclear what caused the price increase of the locally produced Highland milk powder. In this way, the prices of almost all goods in the country were subject to price hikes by two to three-folds. Some traders and manufacturers put the prices of goods up according to their whims and fancies.\nWhen I entered a particular supermarket, I was surprised to see how their staff was relabelling the price tags of the commodities with higher prices. I think most supermarkets did the same. The prices of goods started to rise mainly due to low production of goods in the country, limitations in foreign supply chains, shortage of foreign exchange and depreciation of the rupee. The price hike reached its maximum level in June and July in 2022. When considering the prices of goods during the post-independence period, there was not a significant decrease in prices but showed an increase in them.\nThe reason for that trend was that there was a continuous increase in inflation. On the other hand, there was a continuous increase in prices of goods mainly due to over dependency of foreign goods and the continuous depreciation of the rupee. When considering the situation in other countries, it seems that the price of goods had not gone down, but had gone up.\nThe increase in commodity prices after the Covid-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka was an unusual situation. The above mentioned special reasons have affected but after easing off those reasons there should be a decrease in the prices of goods. For example, the situation caused by the devaluation of the rupee can be mentioned here. Although the dollar reached Rs. 470, it has now dropped to Rs. 300.\nInflation has come down while the prices of fuel, electricity and bank interest rates have also come down. As a result of those decreases in prices and inflation, the prices of the countryâ€™s goods should decrease to a significant level but such a decrease has not yet been reported. The reason for this is that many producers and traders in the country try to gain high profits by retaining prices of goods at a higher level.\nIn this way, the people are not getting the benefit of price decrease as the importers and local producers do not reduce the prices of goods and services according to the changes in the cost of production. But the manufacturers, importers and traders have not realised that they are compelled to reduce the prices willingly or unwillingly, soon.\nBuilding materials\nWhen prices are high, people donâ€™t buy goods, therefore sellers have to bear the losses. For example, the price of building materials in the country has increased significantly but there has been no change in those prices when the dollar has decreased. As a result, the countryâ€™s construction industry has badly affected and a drastic decrease in building material sales. This has caused a huge loss to those who sell building materials. However, there is a price reduction in some of the building materials and a further price reduction of those materials can be expected. When the prices of building material are reduced, there will be a boom in the construction industry.\nWhen there is a price reduction in goods, it will boost the economy due to high the demand. The demand increases when peopleâ€™s purchasing power is increased. It will increase the demand for goods in all sectors while production of all sectors is increased. This will ultimately result in a sound economic growth.\nIt is now evident that the government has taken all measures to reduce the prices of goods while strengthening the rupee value. Fuel, electricity and bank loan interest have now been reduced resulting in the reduction in production cost. But, there is no significant price reduction in goods and services yet.\nEven though there is a considerable price increase of a loaf of bread, it seems that today there is a competition between bakery owners. While some bakery owners are trying to maintain the current prices of a loaf of bread, some owners seem ready to reduce the price of bread. The end result may be that the price of bread will gradually decrease. This is the case with all goods and services. When the cost of production is reduced and the prices are not reduced compared to the production cost, a price competition will be created and that will result in the price reduction of goods.\nDue to proper economic management by President Ranil Wickremesinghe amidst various challenges and difficulties, an environment has now been created in the country to reduce the prices of goods. If the manufacturing sector understands this scenario and reduces prices, an accelerated economic growth of the country is imminent.\nThe post Economic growth imminent with price reduction of goods

unionist rugby referees hit schoolboys below the belt','Schoolboys from as many as 83 rugby playing schools have been held to ransom by striking referees following an assault on one of their members making a mockery of sports promotion in the country where strikes and trade union actions are despised and frowned upon.\nIn an age when rogue conduct and rampant corruption among so-called caretakers of sports in the country rule the roost, schoolboys have been made pawns, their keepers become showcase puppets and their commercial partners turned into sadists while thugs call the shots and referees resort to a boycott of rugby, a sport they claim to foster and even earn from.\nThe disruption came barely a month after the new inter-school rugby season was launched with players paraded on stage and the Ministers of Education and Sports gracing the occasion making speeches promising fair-play and accountability.\nBut all bought to zero with three match officials brutalized by thug supporters of one school Science College last Sunday at the Air Force ground at Ratmalana considered the safest of all venues without any pre-match complaints.\nWith a new set of referees now running the show and their decisions respected by players over the past few years, resorting to trade union action made them pathetically ordinary in their off-field conduct unbecoming of match officials who are paid to perform a task.\nThe contention is that had the referees been bold enough as they are on the field of play, they should have taught Science College a lesson and refused to blow only their matches and not penalize other schools that had nothing to do with last Sundayâ€™s incident.\nThe so-called Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association, the caretaker of the countryâ€™s rugby cradle, and their new found Advisors did very little to prevent the disruption of matches living up to a puppet or self-professed image while hundreds of schoolboys who were put through hard rigorous pre-season training for the occasion were left jaded.\nThe action taken by the referees smacked of typical Sri Lanka style where the rest have to pay for the sins of one man or individuals fighting for their rights at the expense of the people.\nWhat cannot be hidden from the truth is that the referees had hit the players of 83 schools below the belt in a spoil-sport move most foul despite police moving in swiftly and arresting the assailants who could face charges of criminal assault.\nThe post Trade unionist rugby referees hit schoolboys below the belt appeared first on Sunday
